The second part of the workshop series focused on training sessions on some 
tools that can be used (or useful for) data science in the classroom. The four 
lessons are (links will take you to the actual lessons, which are hosted 
elsewhere):

+ [Data visualization with ggplot](https://jcoliver.github.io/learn-r/004-intro-ggplot.html):
Data visualization is a powerful means of communicating concepts and patterns 
in data. Getting your visualizations to look _good_ in R can take some work, 
but the ggplot2 package makes it easier. This lesson introduces how to use 
ggplot2 package to create publication-quality graphics.
+ [Easier data manipulation with the tidyverse](https://jcoliver.github.io/learn-r/012-intro-tidyverse.html):
R is a powerful language for managing, analyzing, and visualizing complex data. 
However, some of the commands in R are esoteric or just plain confusing. The 
tidyverse package for R includes several helpful functions that make it easier 
to manipulate, summarize, and visualize your data. In this lesson weâ€™ll use 
these functions to create plots from summary statistics.
+ [An introduction to RStudio and GitHub](https://jcoliver.github.io/learn-r/010-github.html):
The Git system is designed to make collaboration easier and more transparent. 
This lesson provides an introduction to the version control system Git, one 
central sharing point called GitHub, and how you can use the two in RStudio.
+ [Making web pages with Quarto](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/creating-quarto-websites/): 
This tutorial, written by [Sam Csik](https://samanthacsik.github.io/), provides 
an introduction to the Quarto system for making webpages hosted on GitHub. 
Quarto websites are a (relatively) accessible means of creating and provide 
content for data science learning goals.
