### Planning class content

After deciding on a list of core skills your learners need, and creating a set 
of well-targeted, diagnostic exercises, you can then start to create the bulk 
of the content for the lesson. This material can be thought of as the "script" 
for you to follow while teaching and should be planned to complement the 
exercises you have already designed. 

If you have taken the time to go through these steps of identifying skills and 
creating exercises, the remaining parts of the development process will be much 
more straightforward and take less time than if you try to start with 
developing content. Its OK if your list of skills and set of exercises changes 
a little as you develop your lesson content - none of us get it right on the 
first try - however, if you have invested time in the first two steps of the 
backward design process, these changes should be fairly small.
