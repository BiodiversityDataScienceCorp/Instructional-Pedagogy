# Assessing Learning Progress

## Lesson objectives

+ Write formative assessments to measure learning objectives 

## Overview

Today will be focused time to work on your learning objectives and assessments 
for those objectives.

## Formative assessments work

<div class="exercise" markdown="1">
**Exercise**

Take time now to revisit your learning objectives you wrote earlier. Based on 
your reflection and peer review. What changes would you like to make?

**Exercise**

Now take time writing assessments for your remaining learning objectives. After
30 minutes you will have an opportunity to provide one another feedback.

**Exercise**

Provide feedback on your peers' assessments. Are there additional ways they 
could minimize the cognitive load for their students?

## Topic 2

### Planning class content

After deciding on a list of core skills your learners need, and creating a set 
of well-targeted, diagnostic exercises, you can then start to create the bulk 
of the content for the lesson. This material can be thought of as the "script" 
for you to follow while teaching and should be planned to complement the 
exercises you have already designed. 

If you have taken the time to go through these steps of identifying skills and 
creating exercises, the remaining parts of the development process will be much 
more straightforward and take less time than if you try to start with 
developing content. Its OK if your list of skills and set of exercises changes 
a little as you develop your lesson content - none of us get it right on the 
first try - however, if you have invested time in the first two steps of the 
backward design process, these changes should be fairly small.

**Homework**

Next week we will be focused on identifying data sets to use in class and for 
assessments. For the next session, start thinking about the minimal 
requirements for data that you would like to use.
