## Reverse instructional design

Backward design is an instructional design model that starts with identifying 
the desired outcomes of a learning experience, including core skills and 
concepts that learners need to acquire. These identified outcomes are used to 
develop course content and assessments to measure learners' progress towards 
these outcomes.

In essence, the backward design process has three stages:

1. Identify the practical skills we aim to teach.
2. Design formative assessments to give an opportunity for our learners to 
practice and integrate these skills.
3. Identify what we need to teach for our learners to acquire these skills.

This approach ensures that all the skills you teach work together to meet the 
over-arching goals of your curriculum. It also reduces the risk that you won't 
teach a concept learners need in order to be able to master the skills you aim 
to teach. Similarly, it avoids teaching topics that do not help you (and your 
learners) meet our goals.

Reducing distractions is part of our lesson design as we strive to reduce 
cognitive load on learners. To this end, we will also talk about how to develop 
lessons centered around a narrative and a data set students can relate with 
quickly.

### Practical skills

We emphasize teaching "good enough practices" - concrete skills that are 
accessible, able to be adopted by researchers of any skill level, and likely to 
make an immediate positive impact on learners' work. Teaching defensive 
programming, how to use spreadsheets effectively, or how to organize files 
consistently across research projects, are practical skills that can save a lot 
time when learners apply them in their own research.

When developing a new curriculum, the first step is to identify the skills that 
will be the most immediately useful to learners and have the biggest impact on 
their work. This will vary a lot, so having a clear idea of your lesson's 
intended audience is critical at this stage.

participants to just make a list of the skills. Maybe start even higher up, 
like defining what you want students to _do_.

### Designing assessments

Once you have identified these high-impact skills, the lesson content should be 
designed to create frequent opportunities for learners to practice these skills 
while exemplifying the tasks they perform in their daily work. Live coding and 
hands-on formative assessments that learners can directly relate to should 
allow them to envision how they can start using the skills taught with their 
own data as soon as the class session is over.

In much of traditional Western instruction, learners are presented with new 
material during course time and then sent home to practice applying the 
concepts learned on their own. A major limitation of this approach is that 
learners often encounter difficulties in trying to apply their new knowledge or 
skills and need to troubleshoot on their own, without support. Education 
research shows that novices learn best when they are given feedback and 
coaching in real time while practicing their new skills so that errors are 
corrected and missteps redirected before mistakes have a chance to become 
discouraging or ingrained in learners' memory.

To this end, we should provide frequent opportunities for learners to practice 
new skills. To be helpful in providing useful feedback, these opportunities 
need to both be:

1. narrowly targeted to the skills that have been taught (i.e. not to depend on 
untaught concepts), and;
2. diagnostic (instructors should be able to tell what the learner is 
misunderstanding based on how they answer the question).

</div>

**TODO**: Peer review of assessment. Additional misconceptions? 
</div>

This is the start, and we will have more time next session to write assessments
for your learning objectives. Also note that your list of skills and learning 
objectives can change as you develop your lesson.

### Designing assessments
The assessments in a lesson should be a mixture of direct applications and 
synthesis. A direct application is a straightforward implementation of a 
concept that learners have just been exposed to, while synthesis requires 
learners to integrate recently learned skills with skills that were covered 
earlier in the lesson. Learning is reinforced when you explicitly point out how 
the skills seen in earlier parts of the lesson are being integrated in the 
assessments.

Formative assessments help learners further their learning by having a chance 
to put into practice the skills being taught. They also help you monitor the 
level of understanding in the classroom, and potentially catch misconceptions 
in the learner's mental models that can be corrected in real time, before they 
become ingrained.

When starting to design assessments, it is helpful to start by planning the 
_last_ exercise of the class. This will help you keep the big picture in mind 
and ensure that the rest of the exercises you develop lead up to this 
larger goal. These final assessments are also the most likely to be 
"unscaffolded", and so are easier to develop without detailed knowledge of the 
various types of exercises we will discuss later. Such a final assessment may 
include an assessment of multiple (or even all) of the learning objectives for 
your lesson.

<div class="exercise" markdown="1">
**Exercise**

Draft a final assessment to assess some or all of the learning objectives you 
listed in the previous exercise. This can be more open-ended than some of the 
formative assessments we have talked about previously, but don't leave your 
students confused about what they are supposed to do. e.g. "Describe evolution" 
might be a bit to vague. It may not necessarily be something that would take 
place synchronously (i.e. it could be homework) or during the same class period
(i.e. group work during the next class).
