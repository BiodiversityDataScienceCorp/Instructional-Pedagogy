# Applied Lesson Development

## Lesson objectives

+ Describe the data science module you intend to develop
+ Identify desired skills to teach
+ Write learning objectives for in-class data science module
+ Design formative assessments to monitor learning progress

## Overview

Today we will start work in earnest on your data science modules! We will start
with a review of reverse instructional design, then provide an opportunity to 
brainstorm with your peers on your module ideas. We will then move into working 
with learning objectives and assessing student's progress.

### Logistics

For this second three week session, we will be offering more time for you to 
work on your modules and receive peer feedback. We will also be doing some 
instructional sessions based on the feedback you received.

## Reverse instructional design

Backward design is an instructional design model that starts with identifying 
the desired outcomes of a learning experience, including core skills and 
concepts that students need to acquire. These identified outcomes are used to 
develop course content and assessments to measure students' progress towards 
these outcomes.

In essence, the backward design process has three stages:

1. Identify the practical skills we aim to teach.
2. Design formative assessments to give an opportunity for our students to 
practice and integrate these skills.
3. Identify what we need to teach for our students to acquire these skills.

This approach ensures that all the skills you teach work together to meet the 
over-arching goals of your curriculum. It also reduces the risk that you won't 
teach a concept students need in order to be able to master the skills you aim 
to teach. Similarly, it avoids teaching topics that do not help you (and your 
students) meet our goals.

Reducing distractions is part of our lesson design as we strive to reduce 
cognitive load on students. To this end, we will also talk about how to develop 
lessons centered around a narrative and a data set students can relate with 
quickly.

<div class="exercise" markdown="1">
**Exercise**

In groups, describe the data science module you would like to deploy in your 
classroom. Start by sharing the **course** you will teach the module in, then 
the **audience** for the module (i.e. who the students are). Then provide a 
general description of the tool or resource you want to teach your students.

Provide feedback to other group members on their ideas. Some things to 
consider: in the spirit of "teach the most useful first", how does this idea 
fit? What what is the knowledge or skills that students will need to bring to 
this lesson (this is that "intrinsic" cognitive load we talked about).
</div>

### Practical skills

We emphasize teaching "good enough practices" - concrete skills that are 
accessible and likely to make an immediate positive impact on students' work. 
Teaching defensive programming, how to use spreadsheets effectively, or how to 
organize files consistently across research projects, are practical skills that 
can save a lot time when students apply them in their own work.

When developing a new module, the first step is to identify the skills that 
will be the most immediately useful to students and have the biggest impact on 
their work. This will vary a lot, so having a clear idea of your lesson's 
intended audience is critical at this stage.

<div class="exercise" markdown="1">
**Exercise**

Based on the discussions you had with your group, take a few minutes to list 
the skills you want your students to come away with after completing the class 
module. Add this list of skills to the collaborative document.

Now, looking at those skills, revise them so they are learning objectives. 
Consider where on Bloom's taxonomy those learning objectives would be. Add the 
learning objectives to the collaborative document.
</div>

### Designing assessments

Once you have identified these high-impact skills, the lesson content should be 
designed to create frequent opportunities for students to practice these skills 
while exemplifying the tasks they perform in their daily work. Live coding and 
hands-on formative assessments that students can directly relate to should 
allow them to envision how they can start using the skills taught with their 
own data as soon as the class session is over.

In much of traditional Western instruction, students are presented with new 
material during course time and then sent home to practice applying the 
concepts learned on their own. A major limitation of this approach is that 
students often encounter difficulties in trying to apply their new knowledge or 
skills and need to troubleshoot on their own, without support. Education 
research shows that novices learn best when they are given feedback and 
coaching in real time while practicing their new skills so that errors are 
corrected and missteps redirected before mistakes have a chance to become 
discouraging or ingrained in students' memory.

To this end, we should provide frequent opportunities for students to practice 
new skills. To be helpful in providing useful feedback, these opportunities 
need to both be:

1. narrowly targeted to the skills that have been taught (i.e. not to depend on 
untaught concepts), and;
2. diagnostic (instructors should be able to tell what the student is 
misunderstanding based on how they answer the question).

<div class="exercise" markdown="1">
**Exercise**

Pick one of your learning objectives from above and design an assessment for 
you as an instructor to assess how well the student understands the concept 
being taught. Remember to make the assessment:

1. Narrowly targeted to the skills that have been taught
2. Diagnostic to provide you information on potential misconceptions

When you have finished drafting the assessment, add it to the collaborative 
document.
</div>

<div class="exercise" markdown="1">
**Exercise**

Now share your learning objective and the accompanying assessment with your 
group. Taking turns, review your peers' assessments addressing these two 
questions:

1. Is the assessment narrow enough to focus on the skills being taught?
2. Are there additional misconceptions that might be caught?
</div>

This is the start, and we will have more time to write assessments for your 
learning objectives. Also note that your list of skills and learning objectives 
can change as you develop your lesson.

### Designing assessments
The assessments in a lesson should be a mixture of direct applications and 
synthesis. A direct application is a straightforward implementation of a 
concept that students have just been exposed to, while synthesis requires 
students to integrate recently learned skills with skills that were covered 
earlier in the lesson. Learning is reinforced when you explicitly point out how 
the skills seen in earlier parts of the lesson are being integrated in the 
assessments.

Formative assessments help students further their learning by having a chance 
to put into practice the skills being taught. They also help you monitor the 
level of understanding in the classroom, and potentially catch misconceptions 
in the student's mental models that can be corrected in real time, before they 
become ingrained.

When starting to design assessments, it is helpful to start by planning the 
_last_ exercise of the class. This will help you keep the big picture in mind 
and ensure that the rest of the exercises you develop lead up to this 
larger goal. These final assessments are also the most likely to be 
"unscaffolded", and so are easier to develop without detailed knowledge of the 
various types of exercises we will discuss later. Such a final assessment may 
include an assessment of multiple (or even all) of the learning objectives for 
your lesson.

<div class="exercise" markdown="1">
**Exercise**

Draft a final assessment to assess some or all of the learning objectives you 
listed in the previous exercise. This can be more open-ended than some of the 
formative assessments we have talked about previously, but don't leave your 
students confused about what they are supposed to do. e.g. "Describe evolution" 
might be a bit to vague. It may not necessarily be something that would take 
place synchronously (i.e. it could be homework) or during the same class period
(i.e. group work during the next class).
</div>

<div class="exercise" markdown="1">
**Exercise**

Based on this overarching assessment, have a neighbor draw a concept map of the
concepts and connections that are required for this assessment. Are there 
things in the concept map that you missed?
</div>

<div class="exercise" markdown="1">
**Homework**

Next time you will have time for writing more assessments for learning 
objectives. Remember, the list of skills and learning objectives you wrote 
earlier are not set in stone! For next time, think about how you might revise 
your objectives based on the peer feedback you received today.
