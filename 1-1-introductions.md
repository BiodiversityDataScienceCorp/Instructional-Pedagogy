### Context

This training is part of the NSF-funded project "Building Capacity in Data 
Science through Biodiversity, Conservation, and General Education" (Awards 
[2122967](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2122967) 
and [2122991](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2122991)). 

[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) is a non-profit organization that 
teaches foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide. 
These are most often advertised as Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, and 
Library Carpentry workshops. The organization has a curriclum for _training_ 
the folks who instruct in those workshops, and much of the material in this 
first session comes from that 
[instructor training curriculum](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/). 

Now we would like to hear from you.
