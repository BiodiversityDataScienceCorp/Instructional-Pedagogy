# Introductions and Expectations
 
## Lesson objectives

+ Identify common ground with some of your fellow workshop participants
+ Describe what will and will not be covered in this workshop

## Introductions

### Instructors

As participants come in, add name and e-mail to the collaborative document.

(Instructors will introduce themselves)

### Context

This training is part of the NSF-funded project "Building Capacity in Data 
Science through Biodiversity, Conservation, and General Education" (Awards 
[2122967](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2122967) 
and [2122991](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2122991)). The 
goals of the grant are really two-fold:

1. Provide accessible data science skills training to undergraduate students, 
with an emphasis, but not restriction, to STEM fields.
2. Provide professional development opportunities to instructors of those 
undergraduate students, so they can feel empowered to teach data science 
applications in their classrooms.

[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) is a non-profit organization that 
teaches foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide. 
These are most often advertised as Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, and 
Library Carpentry workshops. The organization has a curriculum for _training_ 
the folks who instruct in those workshops, and much of the material in this 
first session comes from that 
[instructor training curriculum](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/). 

Now we would like to hear from you.

## Expectations

We look to you all to support one another during these sessions. Like your 
students, the participants in this workshop come from a variety of backgrounds 
and disciplines and we expect respectful behavior. We are all here to learn how 
to do our work better, not make trouble for our peers.

In short, donâ€™t be a jerk.

### Logistics

We will meet twice a week, for two hours each. We'll aim to take a short break 
(10 minutes) near the midpoint of each session, although the exact time will 
depend on the day's material. We will also hold office hours on Wednesday 
afternoon for an hour at 2:30pm on Zoom.

We will be using the collaborative document to share answers and information; 
for those on Zoom, we will be occasionally using breakout rooms. For those who 
are participating in person, there will be points where we will ask you to 
split into groups and for the small group activities. We will be switching back 
in forth between passive learning (i.e. me talking to you) and active learning, 
where you are provided prompts to respond to. Towards the end of this first 
three-week session, you will also have opportunities to do some practice 
teaching.

### What will be covered

In the first week, we focus on the process of building skill. We will also talk 
about the limits of human memory, how learning works, and how we can use that 
understanding to craft our instructional practices.

In the second week, we turn to the classroom environment, starting with the 
concept of reverse instructional design. We will discuss how to motivate 
students and how _not_ to demotivate them. We will also have discussions about 
improving equity, inclusion, and accessibility in data science training.

The third week will focus on the practice of teaching data science skills and 
how we can intentionally improve our skills as teachers. We will wrap up the 
third week by looking ahead to the second summer session.

### What will not be covered

In this first session, we will not be teaching programming or specific data 
science skills, instead focusing on how to teach those skills. There will be a 
point where we ask for your input on the shape and scope of the second summer 
session. While we will not be covering things like how to setup a computing 
environment for your students in this first session, we could, should there be 
interest, include a module on that in the second summer session.
