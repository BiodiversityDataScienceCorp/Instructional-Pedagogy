+ Describe data science module implementation
+ Explain growth opportunities

## Overview

In this final session, we will be looking forward to implementing data science 
modules in the classroom. We will take time to identify the

**Exercise**

**Think-Pair-Share**: What are you most apprehensive about?

+ Start by considering the data science module you are planning for your class.
What part are you not sure about? Or think you need more practice on? Take 
about **three minutes** for this.
+ Share your reservation(s) with your group. What resources would you need in 
order to make you less apprehensive about the module? Think big, like more 
people, more computers; ignore reality and budgets for now.
+ As you listen, provide feedback on resources you know of that would help your 
group members deliver their data science module successfully.

**Exercise**

**Think-Pair-Share**: What are you excited to try in your classroom?

+ Start by thinking about how you are going to implement the data science 
module in your classroom. Write down (either on paper, your computer or in the 
collaborative document) what you are excited about. This should take about 
**three minutes**.
+ In your groups, describe what you are excited about and _why_. How will this 
be different from what you have taught in the past?
+ As you listen, provide feedback on additional considerations that should be 
accounted for in delivery of this module. Will students have sufficient access 
to resources such as computers? What additional preparation or materials would 
make this module successful?
