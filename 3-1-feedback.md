# Building Skill with Feedback

## Lesson objectives

+ Give thoughtful and useful feedback
+ Incorporate feedback to improve your instruction

## Overview

In this session, we will focus on ourselves as teachers. We have talked a lot 
about getting feedback from our students to assess their learning progress, but 
how can we, as instructors, use feedback to improve our teaching skill?

<div class="exercise" markdown="1">
**Exercise**

Last week we talked about motivation in the classroom. Reply to one of the 
prompts below: 

+ When teaching, have you ever had to recover from a bad start where you 
demotivated your students? What did you do (or what _should_ you have done) to 
get back to a positive learning environment?
+ Have you been a student in a class where the instructor got off on the wrong 
foot? What could they have done to get things back on track?
</div>

## Aside: tools and platforms for course 2

Before we get into feedback, we would like to take a few minutes to introduce 
some of the tools that you might be interested in teaching in your classroom, 
talk about some platforms that can help in delivering of that material, 
communicate what we expect the deliverables of the next session to be, and get 
a sense from you about what you are interested in learning during the second 
three week session. 

### Possible undergraduate topics

First, I want to mention a pair of tools that you might be interested in using 
for an undergraduate data science module. The first is called OpenRefine, and 
it is a great resource for data management and data cleaning. It has a 
graphical user interface and works through a web browser. It is especially good 
for making data sets that have consistent formatting and helps reduce duplicate 
entries. I want to highlight just how important a skill this is for 
undergraduates to learn. Data science is going nowhere without good data 
management. Some estimates from folks in the trenches estimate as much at 80% 
of their time is spent cleaning up data.

The second is the R programming language. What I'm going to say about 
R will apply to Python as well, for the most part. What does R do? R is a 
command line scripting language that allows you to do reproducible data 
analysis and data visualization. It is open source and has many packages that 
are specialized for various fields like ecology, survival analysis, and 
econometrics to name a few.

### Platforms to help

When delivering data science modules, we often want to share code and create an 
environment for our students to work in. There is a pair of resources that can 
be useful to this end. The first is GitHub, which is one of several code 
sharing websites (there is a lot more to GitHub than this, but for our purposes
we will focus on the code sharing aspect). The second is Binder, which is a way 
to provide access to an R or Python session through a web browser. GitHub and 
Binder work well together, although there are a couple of tricky bits one has 
to watch out for.

### What you should get out of it

Creating data science modules take time, and we want to be sure everyone 
understands what we will be able to accomplish in the next three week session.
After the three weeks, we expect you should have:

1. A set of learning objectives that you want your module to accomplish
2. A suite of formative assessments you can use to determine how well the 
learning objectives have been met
3. A data set you can use for your module
4. An understanding of the platforms you can use to deliver the module

_After_ we finish, you should then have a rich outline that will serve as the 
foundation of your module. You'll be able to fill in the narrative and refine 
the data and assessments as necessary.

### What do you want to learn?

<div class="exercise" markdown="1">
**Exercise**

Considering the tools and platforms we talked about, as well as the 
deliverables you can expect to walk away with, we have two questions for you:

1. What type of data science module would you like to have in your class? (place 
a "1", "2", "3" next to your first, second, and third choices below)

+ Data hygiene with OpenRefine (or similar platform)
+ Data hygiene with programming language (e.g. R or Python)
+ Data analysis with programming language (e.g. R or Python)

2. What tools / platforms are you interested in learning about for the purposes 
of your data science module? (place an "X" next to all that apply)

+ OpenRefine
+ R programming
+ Python programming
+ GitHub
+ Binder
+ Other (list below)

## Feedback is hard

Sometimes it can be hard to receive feedback, especially negative feedback.

Feedback is most effective when the people involved share ground rules and 
expectations. One useful approach is to balance feedback on what works with 
constructive feedback on areas that could use improvement (and _how_ they could
be improved). We also want feedback on both _what_ is being taught (the 
content) and _how_ it is being taught (the presentation). Each person giving 
feedback is expected to provide at least one piece of negative and one piece of 
positive feedback each for content and delivery. This helps overcome two common 
tendencies when giving feedback on teaching: to focus on the content (even 
though delivery is at least as important) and to either provide only negative 
or only positive feedback.

A couple ways you can set the stage for receiving or providing feedback are:

+ **Initiate feedback**. Most people will not offer it freely, and those who do 
are not the only voices you should listen to. Also, it is easier to hear 
feedback that you have asked for.
+ **Be specific**. What do you want feedback on? As an instructor one way to 
get specific feedback is to provide questions that focus the responses. Writing 
your own feedback questions allows you to frame feedback in a way that is 
helpful to you - the questions below reveal what did not work in your teaching, 
but read as professional suggestions rather than personal judgments. For 
example:
    + "What is one thing I could have done as an instructor to make this lesson 
    more effective?"
    + "If you could pick one thing from the lesson to go over again, what would 
    it be?"
+ **Balance** positive and negative feedback.
    + Ask for or give "compliment sandwiches" (one positive, one negative, one 
      positive)
    + Ask for both types of feedback, and give both types.
+ When you are giving feedback, provide a clear **next step** with negative 
feedback to follow that will help the recipient improve. i.e. Don't be reviewer 
2!
+ **Communicate expectations**. If your teaching feedback is taking the form of 
an observation (and you are comfortable enough with the observer), tell that 
person how they can best communicate their feedback to you.
+ When giving feedback, remember that giving and receiving **feedback is a 
skill** that requires practice, so do not be frustrated if your feedback is 
rejected but try to think about why the recipient might not have been 
comfortable with the feedback you gave.
+ Use a **feedback translator**. Have someone else read over all the feedback 
and give an executive summary. It can be easier to hear "It sounds like most 
people are ahead with the materials, so you could speed up" rather than reading 
a bunch of notes that all say "this is too slow".
+ Finally, **be kind** to yourself. If you are a self-critical person, it is OK 
to remind yourself:
    + The feedback is not personal. In many cases, feedback says more about the 
    person giving it than the person receiving it.
    + There are always positives along with the negatives. Save your favorites.

### Provide feedback

We will start by observing an example of teaching and providing some feedback.

<div class="exercise" markdown="1">
**Exercise**

Watch this example teaching video and then give feedback on it 
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ApVt04rB4U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ApVt04rB4U). 
Put your feedback in the collaborative document. Organize your feedback along 
two axes: positive vs. opportunities for growth (sometimes called "negative") 
and content (what was said) vs. presentation (how it was said).
</div>

### Receive feedback

Now that you have had some practice observing teaching and giving feedback, let 
us practice with each other.

<div class="exercise" markdown="1">
**Exercise**

The prep time for this exercise is intentionally short - the 
point is to practice giving and receiving feedback, not to create a perfect 
presentation. Imperfect presentations will give you more to work with!

1. Split into groups of three (your instructor will likely send you to breakout
  rooms, or if you are co-located, will assign groups).
2. Individually, spend 5 minutes preparing a 90-second introduction to the 
topic you picked out after last session. You won't be doing any "live coding" 
or exercises with your audience (this time).
3. Get together with your group and have one person teach their segment to the 
group. Keep a strict time limit of 90 seconds per person (one person should be 
responsible for the timekeeping).
4. After the first person has finished teaching, share feedback. The person who 
performed should start by offering feedback on **themselves**. The timekeeper 
should help to keep feedback to about 5 minutes per person to ensure everyone 
has time to perform and discuss.
5. Rotate roles and repeat steps 3 & 4.
6. Return to the main group and briefly summarize the feedback you received in 
the collaborative document.
</div>

### Use feedback

<div class="exercise" markdown="1">
**Exercise**

Look back at the feedback you received on your teaching. How do 
you feel about this feedback? Is it fair and reasonable? Do you agree with it?

Identify at least one specific change you will make to your teaching based on 
this feedback. Describe your change in the collaborative document.
</div>

## Summary

Remember, teaching is a skill that is learned. If you notice yourself feeling 
hurt or threatened by the feedback you got, or rejecting it as unfair or wrong, 
pause and try to consider the feedback from a growth mindset - that through 
practice and feedback, your skills are going to improve.
