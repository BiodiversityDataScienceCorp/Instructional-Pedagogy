# Building Skill with Feedback

## Lesson objectives

+ Give thoughtful and useful feedback
+ Incorporate feedback to improve your instruction

## Overview

In this session, we will focus on ourselves as teachers. We have talked a lot 
about getting feedback from our students to assess their learning progress, but 
how can we, as instructors, use feedback to improve our teaching skill?

**Exercise**

Last week we covered reverse instructional design and strategies for creating a 
positive learning environment. What areas would you like more clarification on? 
What areas are you excited to apply in your classroom?

## Feedback is hard

Sometimes it can be hard to receive feedback, especially negative feedback.

Feedback is most effective when the people involved share ground rules and 
expectations. One useful approach is to balance feedback on what works with 
constructive feedback on areas that could use improvement (and _how_ they could
be improved). We also want feedback on both _what_ is being taught (the 
content) and _how_ it is being taught (the presentation). Each person giving 
feedback is expected to provide at least one piece of negative and one piece of 
positive feedback each for content and delivery. This helps overcome two common 
tendencies when giving feedback on teaching: to focus on the content (even 
though delivery is at least as important) and to either provide only negative 
or only positive feedback.

A couple ways you can set the stage for receiving or providing feedback are:

+ **Initiate feedback**. Most people will not offer it freely, and those who do 
are not the only voices you should listen to. Also, it is easier to hear 
feedback that you have asked for.
+ **Be specific**. What do you want feedback on? As an instructor one way to 
get specific feedback is to provide questions that focus the responses. Writing 
your own feedback questions allows you to frame feedback in a way that is 
helpful to you - the questions below reveal what did not work in your teaching, 
but read as professional suggestions rather than personal judgments. For 
example:
    + "What is one thing I could have done as an instructor to make this lesson 
    more effective?"
    + "If you could pick one thing from the lesson to go over again, what would 
    it be?"
+ **Balance** positive and negative feedback.
    + Ask for or give "compliment sandwiches" (one positive, one negative, one 
      positive)
    + Ask for both types of feedback, and give both types.
+ When you are giving feedback, provide a clear **next step** with negative 
feedback to follow that will help the recipient improve. i.e. Don't be reviewer 
2!
+ **Communicate expectations**. If your teaching feedback is taking the form of 
an observation (and you are comfortable enough with the observer), tell that 
person how they can best communicate their feedback to you.
+ When giving feedback, remember that giving and receiving **feedback is a 
skill** that requires practice, so do not be frustrated if your feedback is 
rejected but try to think about why the recipient might not have been 
comfortable with the feedback you gave.
+ Use a **feedback translator**. Have someone else read over all the feedback 
and give an executive summary. It can be easier to hear "It sounds like most 
people are ahead with the materials, so you could speed up" rather than reading 
a bunch of notes that all say "this is too slow".
+ Finally, **be kind** to yourself. If you are a self-critical person, it is OK 
to remind yourself:
    + The feedback is not personal. In many cases, feedback says more about the 
    person giving it than the person receiving it.
    + There are always positives along with the negatives. Save your favorites.

### Provide feedback

We will start by observing an example of teaching and providing some feedback.

<div class="exercise" markdown="1">
**Exercise**

Watch this example teaching video and then give feedback on it 
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ApVt04rB4U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ApVt04rB4U). 
Put your feedback in the collaborative document. Organize your feedback along 
two axes: positive vs. opportunities for growth (sometimes called "negative") 
and content (what was said) vs. presentation (how it was said).
</div>

### Receive feedback

Now that you have had some practice observing teaching and giving feedback, let 
us practice with each other.

<div class="exercise" markdown="1">
**Exercise**

The prep time for this exercise is intentionally short - the 
point is to practice giving and receiving feedback, not to create a perfect 
presentation. Imperfect presentations will give you more to work with!

1. Split into groups of three (your instructor will likely send you to breakout
  rooms, or if you are co-located, will assign groups).
2. Individually, spend 5 minutes preparing a 90-second introduction to the topic 
you picked out after last session. You won't be doing any "live coding" or 
exercises with your audience (this time).
3. Get together with your group and have one person teach their segment to the 
group. Keep a strict time limit of 90 seconds per person (one person should be 
responsible for the timekeeping).
4. After the first person has finished teaching, share feedback. The person who 
performed should start by offering feedback on **themselves**. The timekeeper 
should help to keep feedback to about 5 minutes per person to ensure everyone 
has time to perform and discuss.
5. Rotate roles and repeat steps 3 & 4
6. Return to the main group and briefly summarize the feedback you received in 
the collaborative document.

### Use feedback

<div class="exercise" markdown="1">
**Exercise**

Look back at the feedback you received on your teaching. How do 
you feel about this feedback? Is it fair and reasonable? Do you agree with it?

Identify at least one specific change you will make to your teaching based on 
this feedback. Describe your change in the collaborative document.
</div>

## Summary

Remember, teaching is a skill that is learned. If you notice yourself feeling 
hurt or threatened by the feedback you got, or rejecting it as unfair or wrong, 
pause and try to consider the feedback from a growth mindset - that through 
practice and feedback, your skills are going to improve.
