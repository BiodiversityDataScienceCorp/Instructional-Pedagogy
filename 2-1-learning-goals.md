# Learning goals

## Objectives

+ Describe the process of reverse instructional design
+ Explain the levels of Bloomâ€™s taxonomy
+ Apply Bloom's taxonomy to craft learning objectives for lesson

## Overview

When sitting down to plan a class, I think we have all been in the mindset of 
diving right into reviewing the content, questioning our understanding, and 
anticipating questions that learners might have. While it is good to prepare 
your content, this approach can take you down extended rabbit-holes in which 
you anticipate and questions that only an expert (like yourself) would think to 
ask, and never get around to thinking about how to get your students from one 
point to the next, and how to know when they've gotten there. In this session,
we will focus on strategies for designing content to achieve specific learning 
outcomes.

**Exercise** Something reflective on Module 1
**TODO**: Write something to engage folks about skill, memory, or learning.

## Reverse instructional design

When writing curriculum, it is easy to allow **content objectives** to distract 
from learning objectives. One way to prevent this is to take a "reverse" 
approach to instruction, that keeps the focus firmly on learning outcomes. This 
is sometimes also referred to as "backwards design." The order of preparation 
in this case becomes:

1. Determine your learning objectives
2. Decide what constitutes evidence that objectives have been met, and design 
assessments to target that evidence
3. Design instruction: Sort assessments in order of increasing complexity, and 
write content that connects everything together

## Working With Learning Objectives

So how to we actually go about determining learning objectives? Before we go 
into that, we'll take a moment to consider one framework for thinking about the 
learning process and developing material to accomplish learning objectives.

Bloom's Taxonomy is a framework for thinking about learning that breaks 
progress down into discrete, hierarchical steps. While many ideas have come and 
gone in education, Bloom's has remained a useful tool (although I suspect some 
of you might be groaning at this point). It remains useful because the 
hierarchy seems to be reasonably valid: outcomes at the top of the hierarchy 
cannot be achieved without mastery of outcomes at the bottom. In the long term, 
everybody wants to be at the top. However, in aiming to meet students where 
they are, we also need to be mindful about helping them to "grow a level," 
helping them to recognize when they have achieved that growth, and guiding them 
to look ahead to where we might not be able to take them.

**TODO**: There needs to be more explanations of learning objectives here. 
Maybe pull out one or two examples from the examples pasted below and highlight
good (ecology data viz) and bad (spreadsheet format data?) examples.

**Exercise** Evaluate Learning Objectives

Some lessons with Learning objectives that could be useful.

Your instructor has posted links to a handful of current Carpentries lessons in 
the Etherpad. Select one learning objective from one of those lessons, then 
complete the following steps to evaluate it.

+ Identify the learning objective verb. How specifically does this verb 
describe the desired learner outcome?
+ Where does this verb fit on Bloom's taxonomy? Do you think this is an 
appropriate level for your learners?
+ In your opinion, does the lesson do an effective job of meeting the stated 
objective?
+ What would the next level on Bloom's taxonomy look like for your learners? 
How might you be able to help them think ahead to the next level without 
attempting to get them there during your workshop?

## Reflection

**Exercise** Below is an abbreviated, modified selection of "The Rules" from 
Greg Wilson's book "[Teaching Tech Together](https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html)".
Pick one of these points and provide an example of how you have or would adjust
your teaching practice relating to this point.

6. Never hesitate to sacrifice truth for clarity.
8. No lesson survives first contact with learners.
9. Every lesson is too short for the teacher and too long for the learner.
10. Nobody will be more excited about the lesson than you are.
