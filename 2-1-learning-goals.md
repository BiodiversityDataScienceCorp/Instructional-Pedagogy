# Learning goals

## Objectives

+ Describe the process of reverse instructional design
+ Explain the levels of Bloomâ€™s taxonomy
+ Apply Bloom's taxonomy to craft learning objectives for lesson

## Overview

When sitting down to plan a class, I think we have all been in the mindset of 
diving right into reviewing the content, questioning our understanding, and 
anticipating questions that learners might have. While it is good to prepare 
your content, this approach can take you down extended rabbit-holes in which 
you anticipate and questions that only an expert (like yourself) would think to 
ask, and never get around to thinking about how to get your students from one 
point to the next, and how to know when they've gotten there. In this session,
we will focus on strategies for designing content to achieve specific learning 
outcomes.

**TODO**: Write something to engage folks about skill, memory, or learning.

## Reverse instructional design

When writing curriculum, it is easy to allow **content objectives** to distract 
from learning objectives. One way to prevent this is to take a "reverse" 
approach to instruction, that keeps the focus firmly on learning outcomes. This 
is sometimes also referred to as "backwards design." The order of preparation 
in this case becomes:

1. Determine your learning objectives
2. Decide what constitutes evidence that objectives have been met, and design 
assessments to target that evidence
3. Design instruction: Sort assessments in order of increasing complexity, and 
write content that connects everything together

## Working With Learning Objectives

So how to we actually go about determining learning objectives? Before we go 
into that, we'll take a moment to consider one framework for thinking about the 
learning process and developing material to accomplish learning objectives.

Bloom's Taxonomy is a framework for thinking about learning that breaks 
progress down into discrete, hierarchical steps. While many ideas have come and 
gone in education, Bloom's has remained a useful tool (although I suspect some 
of you might be groaning at this point). It remains useful because the 
hierarchy seems to be reasonably valid: outcomes at the top of the hierarchy 
cannot be achieved without mastery of outcomes at the bottom. In the long term, 
everybody wants to be at the top. However, in aiming to meet students where 
they are, we also need to be mindful about helping them to "grow a level," 
helping them to recognize when they have achieved that growth, and guiding them 
to look ahead to where we might not be able to take them.
