## Objectives

+ Describe the process of reverse instructional design
+ Explain the levels of Bloom's taxonomy
+ Apply Bloom's taxonomy to craft learning objectives for lesson
+ Describe strategies for assessing learning goals for just-in-time feedback

## Overview

When sitting down to plan a class, I think we have all been in the mindset of 
diving right into reviewing the content, questioning our understanding, and 
anticipating questions that students might have. While it is good to prepare 
your content, this approach can take you down extended rabbit-holes in which 
you anticipate and questions that only an expert (like yourself) would think to 
ask, and never get around to thinking about how to get your students from one 
point to the next, and how to know when they've gotten there. In this session,
we will focus on strategies for designing content to achieve specific learning 
outcomes.

## Welcome back exercise?

**Exercise** Last week we focused on developing skill, the limits of memory, 
and how learning works. What areas would you like more clarification on? What 
areas are you excited to apply in your classroom?

## Reverse instructional design

When writing curriculum, it is easy to allow **content objectives** to distract 
from learning objectives. One way to prevent this is to take a "reverse" 
approach to instruction, that keeps the focus firmly on learning outcomes. This 
is sometimes also referred to as "backwards design." The order of preparation 
in this case becomes:

1. Determine your learning objectives
2. Decide what constitutes evidence that objectives have been met, and design 
assessments to target that evidence
3. Design instruction: Sort assessments in order of increasing complexity, and 
write content that connects everything together

## Working With Learning Objectives

So how to we actually go about determining learning objectives? Before we go 
into that, we'll take a moment to consider one framework for thinking about the 
learning process and developing material to accomplish learning objectives.

Bloom's Taxonomy is a framework for thinking about learning that breaks 
progress down into discrete, hierarchical steps. While many ideas have come and 
gone in education, Bloom's has remained a useful tool (although I suspect some 
of you might be groaning at this point). It remains useful because the 
hierarchy seems to be reasonably valid: outcomes at the top of the hierarchy 
cannot be achieved without mastery of outcomes at the bottom. In the long term, 
everybody wants to be at the top. However, in aiming to meet students where 
they are, we also need to be mindful about helping them to "grow a level," 
helping them to recognize when they have achieved that growth, and guiding them 
to look ahead to where we might not be able to take them.

When thinking about learning objectives for our purposes, we are going to focus 
on a fairly atomic level. That is, thinking about objectives for a class 
session or two. These will necessarily be different from objectives you would 
write for an entire course. I find it easiest to look at examples of learning 
objectives. Here are two lists of objectives. The first is from a 
[lesson on data visualization in R](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/04-visualization-ggplot2.html).

+ Produce scatter plots, boxplots, and time series plots using ggplot.
+ Set universal plot settings.
+ Describe what faceting is and apply faceting in ggplot (ggplot is a package 
  in R used to create plots).
+ Modify the aesthetics of an existing ggplot plot (including axis labels and 
  color).
+ Build complex and customized plots from data in a data frame.

One important thing to note is that they are all starting with a verb, as they 
describe something a student should be able to accomplish after the lesson. 

**Exercise** Consider the five learning objectives we saw above:

+ Produce scatter plots, boxplots, and time series plots using ggplot.
+ Set universal plot settings.
+ Modify the aesthetics of an existing ggplot plot (including axis labels and 
  color).
+ Build complex and customized plots from data in a data frame.

Where would you place them in the pyramid of Bloom's taxonomy?

We also want to make sure that learning objectives are something we can 
actually assess. Sometimes we might write vague learning objectives that we 
have a difficult time telling if students can do the thing we expect them to. 
For example, the following learning objective comes from a lesson on using 
spreadsheets:

+ Understand how to organize data so computers can make the best use of the 
data

While this understanding _is_ important, it may not be immediately obvious how 
to tell if a student learned the material. In contrast, specific objectives 
will be easier to write assessments for:

+ Recognize and resolve common spreadsheet formatting problems.
+ Describe the importance of metadata.
+ Identify metadata that should be included with a dataset.
+ Apply consistent date formats
+ Use formulas to separate dates into their component values (e.g. Month, Day, 
  Year).

For example, after teaching content to address the first point (common 
spreadsheet formatting problems), we could ask students to provide a better 
organization to these data:

**Exercise** Think about a tool (software or otherwise) that you use or teach 
often. If you were to write a lesson to train students how to use that tool, 
what are three learning objectives that would help guide the development of 
your lesson? Write the tool or analysis and your learning objectives in the 
collaborative document.

## Checking in

When a learning objective has been met, everyone should know about it! You, as 
an instructor, can be satisfied that your teaching has successfully translated 
into learning. For students, recognizing that they have successfully learned 
something is motivating and it also supports their ability to monitor their own 
progress - this awareness, or metacognition, is especially key to supporting 
continued learning beyond the classroom. However, not all lessons have 
checkpoints built in where such progress is made clear. Where they do, they can 
pass unnoticed in the absence of focused recognition.

Instructors should use a formative assessment ideally every 5 minutes and at 
least every 10-15 minutes in order to make sure that the class is actually 
learning. Since the average attention span is usually only this long, formative 
assessments also help break up instructional time and re-focus attention. 
Formative assessments can also be used preemptively: if you start a class with 
a question and everyone can answer it correctly, then you can safely skip the 
part of the lecture in which you were going to explain something that your 
students already know.

### Avoiding "Do you understand?"

Students are often reluctant to admit when they do not understand. Furthermore, 
self-assessments of skill in the absence of formative assessment are often 
inaccurate because of the Dunning-Kruger effect: the less people know about a 
subject, the less accurate their estimate of their knowledge is. Therefore, if 
you ask a room full of people "Do you understand?" the result will invariably 
be a number of "yes" responses (many of them inaccurate) which tend to drown 
out a variable amount of silence. Instead, a targeted formative assessment 
takes the inaccuracy and stress of self-judgement away and demonstrates to all 
whether the students' level of understanding has met the instructor's goal.

### Sticky Notes

So you _do_ you assess students' progress without asking? One way is to ask for 
quick check-ins. If you are teaching in-person, you can start the class by 
handing out two sticky notes to each student, say one red one and one green 
one. These can act as "flags" that students can place on the back of their 
laptop screens to indicate when they need help (say, the red note) or when they 
have completed a task and are ready to move on (the green note). These are 
useful because:

+ it is more discreet (which means they are more likely to actually do it),
+ they can keep working while their flag is raised, and
+ the instructor can quickly see from the front of the room what state the 
class is in.

Active and frequent requests are most effective in getting students to actually 
use these well (e.g. "please put up a green sticky note if you completed the 
last step, and a red sticky note if you need help."). Also, I have used "red" 
and "green" because those colors carry certain connotations, but you should 
consider other colors that are easier to differentiate by folks who cannot 
distinguish between red and green.

In online workshops, Zoom has a green "âœ“" and red "x" under "reactions" that 
may be used in place of sticky notes.

### Minute Cards

When possible, at the end of a session, solicit quick, anonymous feedback from 
your students. At an in-person session, those paper sticky notes double as 
minute cards, with the two different colors used for positive and constructive 
feedback. At an online workshop, you can use a platform like Google Forms to 
collect anonymous feedback.

When asking for feedback, we want to provide some structure to guide responses 
(we will talk more about this later). 

+ Example positive prompts:
    + One thing you liked about this class session
    + The most important thing you learned today
    + A new skill, command, or technique you are most excited about using
+ Example constructive prompts:
    + One thing you did not like or would change about this class session
    + One thing that is confusing / you would like clarification on
    + One question you have

### Be explicit about using feedback

Students are more likely to give useful feedback if they feel that their 
feedback is being taken seriously. Spending a few minutes talking about the 
feedback you got and being explicit about what changes you are making in light 
of that feedback will encourage students to continue to give informative 
feedback throughout the course.

## Reflection

**Exercise** Below is an abbreviated, modified selection of "The Rules" from 
Greg Wilson's book "[Teaching Tech Together](https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html)".
Pick one of these points and provide an example of how you have or would adjust
your teaching practice relating to this point.

6. Never hesitate to sacrifice truth for clarity.
8. No lesson survives first contact with students.
9. Every lesson is too short for the teacher and too long for the student.
10. Nobody will be more excited about the lesson than you are.
