# Learning goals

## Objectives

+ Describe the process of reverse instructional design
+ Explain the levels of Bloomâ€™s taxonomy
+ Apply Bloom's taxonomy to craft learning objectives for lesson

## Overview

When sitting down to plan a class, I think we have all been in the mindset of 
diving right into reviewing the content, questioning our understanding, and 
anticipating questions that learners might have. While it is good to prepare 
your content, this approach can take you down extended rabbit-holes in which 
you anticipate and questions that only an expert (like yourself) would think to 
ask, and never get around to thinking about how to get your students from one 
point to the next, and how to know when they've gotten there. In this session,
we will focus on strategies for designing content to achieve specific learning 
outcomes.

## Welcome back exercise?

**Exercise** Something reflective on Module 1
**TODO**: Write something to engage folks about skill, memory, or learning.

## Reverse instructional design

When writing curriculum, it is easy to allow **content objectives** to distract 
from learning objectives. One way to prevent this is to take a "reverse" 
approach to instruction, that keeps the focus firmly on learning outcomes. This 
is sometimes also referred to as "backwards design." The order of preparation 
in this case becomes:

1. Determine your learning objectives
2. Decide what constitutes evidence that objectives have been met, and design 
assessments to target that evidence
3. Design instruction: Sort assessments in order of increasing complexity, and 
write content that connects everything together

## Working With Learning Objectives

So how to we actually go about determining learning objectives? Before we go 
into that, we'll take a moment to consider one framework for thinking about the 
learning process and developing material to accomplish learning objectives.

Bloom's Taxonomy is a framework for thinking about learning that breaks 
progress down into discrete, hierarchical steps. While many ideas have come and 
gone in education, Bloom's has remained a useful tool (although I suspect some 
of you might be groaning at this point). It remains useful because the 
hierarchy seems to be reasonably valid: outcomes at the top of the hierarchy 
cannot be achieved without mastery of outcomes at the bottom. In the long term, 
everybody wants to be at the top. However, in aiming to meet students where 
they are, we also need to be mindful about helping them to "grow a level," 
helping them to recognize when they have achieved that growth, and guiding them 
to look ahead to where we might not be able to take them.

When thinking about learning objectives for our purposes, we are going to focus 
on a fairly atomic level. That is, thinking about objectives for a class 
session or two. These will necessarily be different from objectives you would 
write for an entire course. I find it easiest to look at examples of learning 
objectives. Here are two lists of objectives. The first is from a 
[lesson on data visualization in R](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/04-visualization-ggplot2.html).

+ Produce scatter plots, boxplots, and time series plots using ggplot.
+ Set universal plot settings.
+ Describe what faceting is and apply faceting in ggplot.
+ Modify the aesthetics of an existing ggplot plot (including axis labels and 
  color).
+ Build complex and customized plots from data in a data frame.

One important thing to note is that they are all starting with a verb, as they 
describe something a student should be able to accomplish after the lesson. 

**Exercise** Evaluate Learning Objectives
**TODO**: Could have them place each of the objectives in the Bloom's taxonomy 
pyramid (only one uses a verb that is actually in the pyramid)

We also want to make sure that learning objectives are something we can 
actually assess. Sometimes we might write vague learning objectives that we 
have a difficult time telling if students can do the thing we expect them to. 
For example, the following learning objective comes from a lesson on using 
spreadsheets:

+ Understand how to organize data so computers can make the best use of the 
data

While this understanding _is_ important, it may not be immediately obvious how 
to tell if a student learned the material. In contrast, specific objectives 
will be easier to write assessments for:

+ Recognize and resolve common spreadsheet formatting problems.
+ Describe the importance of metadata.
+ Identify metadata that should be included with a dataset.
+ Apply consistent date formats
+ Use formulas to separate dates into their component values (e.g. Month, Day, 
  Year).

For example, after teaching content to address the first point (common 
spreadsheet formatting problems), we could ask students to provide a better 
organization to these data:

**Exercise** Evaluate Learning Objectives
**TODO**: Add this exercise. Maybe a good point for them to write their own 
learning objectives.

Your instructor has posted links to a handful of current Carpentries lessons in 
the Etherpad. Select one learning objective from one of those lessons, then 
complete the following steps to evaluate it.

+ Identify the learning objective verb. How specifically does this verb 
describe the desired learner outcome?
+ Where does this verb fit on Bloom's taxonomy? Do you think this is an 
appropriate level for your learners?
+ In your opinion, does the lesson do an effective job of meeting the stated 
objective?
+ What would the next level on Bloom's taxonomy look like for your learners? 
How might you be able to help them think ahead to the next level without 
attempting to get them there during your workshop?

## Reflection

**Exercise** Below is an abbreviated, modified selection of "The Rules" from 
Greg Wilson's book "[Teaching Tech Together](https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html)".
Pick one of these points and provide an example of how you have or would adjust
your teaching practice relating to this point.

6. Never hesitate to sacrifice truth for clarity.
8. No lesson survives first contact with learners.
9. Every lesson is too short for the teacher and too long for the learner.
10. Nobody will be more excited about the lesson than you are.
