# The Art of Live Coding

## Lesson objectives

+ Explain the advantages and limitations of participatory live (coding) 
instruction
+ Summarize the key dos and do nots of participatory live (coding) instruction

## Overview

One thing we try to do when incorporating data science into the classroom is 
commonly referred to as "live coding": instructors do not use slides to teach, 
but work through the lesson material, typing in the code or instructions, with 
the students following along. This section explains how it works, why we use 
it, and gives general tips for an effective participatory live coding 
presentation. We will finish this section by practicing ourselves and providing 
feedback for each other.

## Why Participatory Live Coding?

We talk about the practice of "live coding". However, you are not live coding 
in a vacuum. Importantly, students are strongly encouraged to "code-along" with 
you. We refer to the practice of having the instructor live code and the 
students code along as "participatory live coding" or, less formally, as 
"code-along sessions".

**Exercise**

List some advantages and challenges of participatory live coding 
from both a student's and an instructor's point of view in the collaborative
document or discuss with your group.

Live coding fits well into the model we have been discussing - by providing 
students with continuous opportunities for practice (every time they type in a 
line of code) and continuous feedback (their code either works or fails with an 
error message). It is important to keep in mind, however, that feedback is not 
helpful if you cannot understand it. Many error messages are obscure and not 
written with novices in mind. With this in mind, if you are doing live coding 
and make an error, it is an especially good opportunity to explain to your 
students _how_ you go about addressing the error. It is totally OK to include 
Googling for the answer as on of your steps (but maybe not the _first_ step you 
take).

Watch this first participatory live coding demo video: 
[https://youtu.be/bXxBeNkKmJE](https://youtu.be/bXxBeNkKmJE) and this second 
demo video: [https://youtu.be/SkPmwe_WjeY](https://youtu.be/SkPmwe_WjeY) and 
then summarize your feedback on both in the collaborative document. Use the 2x2 
(positive/negative, content/presentation) rubric for feedback we discussed 
earlier.

In the videos, the instructor is teaching students how to use loops to repeat 
as task.

Note: Sometime sounds in the room can be poor. Turning on closed captioning by

## Top eight tips for live coding

1. Stand up and move around the room if possible. This makes the experience more 
interactive and less monotonous. Use a microphone if one is available to make 
it easier for people with hearing difficulties to hear you.
2. Go slowly. For every command you type, every word of code you write, every 
menu item or website button you click, say out loud what you are doing while 
you do it. Then point to the command and its output on the screen and go 
through it a second time. This slows you down and allows students to copy what 
you do, or to catch up. Do not copy-paste code.
3. Mirror your students' environment. Try to create an environment that is as 
similar as possible to what your students have to reduce cognitive load. Avoid 
using keyboard shortcuts.
4. Use your screen wisely. Use a big font, and maximize the window. A black font 
on a white background works better than a light font on a dark background. 
5. Use illustrations to help students understand and organize the material. You 
can also generate the illustrations on the board as you progress through the 
material. This allows you to build up diagrams, making them increasingly 
complex in parallel with the material you are teaching. It helps students 
understand the material, makes for a more lively workshop and gathers the 
students' attention to you as well.
6. Leave no student behind. We will talk later in the workshop how sticky notes 
can be used to gauge students' progress and understanding.
7. Embrace mistakes. No matter how well prepared you are, you will make 
mistakes. This is OK! Use these opportunities to do error framing and to help 
your students learn the art of troubleshooting.
8. Have fun! It is OK to use humor and improvisation to liven up the workshop. 
This becomes easier when you are more familiar with the material, and more 
relaxed. Start small, even just saying 'that was fun' after something worked 
well or you fixed an error is a good start.

## Summary

<div class="exercise" markdown="1">
**Homework**

In the next session you will have opportunities for practicing 
the hands-on live coding we talked about. Please be prepared to teach a short 
part (roughly 3-5 minutes) of a hands-on lesson of your choice. This can be the 
same topic you chose today, or another one. As before, if you do not have 
materials to teach from, we can provide some lessons from the Carpentries 
curriculum for you to work with.
