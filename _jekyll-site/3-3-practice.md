# Building Teaching Skill with Practice

## Lesson objectives

+ Demonstrate participatory live (coding) instruction
+ Use feedback to improve instruction
+ Create a learning objective for your module
+ Constructively critique a peer learning objective
+ Identify checkpoints in a lesson for formative assessment

## Overview

This section provides the opportunity to practice live coding, to go through 
the process of observing and giving feedback, and to make changes to how we 
teach based on the feedback of others.

## Round One

<div class="exercise" markdown="1">
**Exercise**

Now it's your turn for participatory live coding

1. Split into groups of three.
2. Assign roles, which will rotate: presenter, timekeeper, note-taker.
3. Have each group member teach 3 minutes of your chosen lesson episode using 
live coding. For this exercise, your peers will not "code-along." Before you 
begin, briefly describe what you will be teaching and what has been learned 
previously.
4. After each person finishes, each group member should share feedback 
(starting with themselves) using the same 2x2 rubric as before 
(positive/negative, content/presentation). The timekeeper should keep feedback 
discussion to about 1 minute per person; this may leave some time at the end 
for general discussion. The note-taker should record feedback in the 
collaborative document.
5. Trade off roles.

**Break here**

## Round Two

<div class="exercise" markdown="1">
**Exercise**

Return to your groups and repeat the previous live coding 
exercise, re-teaching the same content as before. This time, the presenter 
should incorporate changes based on feedback received, and everyone should 
try to "level up" their feedback using the rubric for teaching demos.

When you are finished, add some thoughts on this process to the collaborative 
document: What did you change? Did it work better or worse with the change? How 
might you do it if you were to teach it again?
