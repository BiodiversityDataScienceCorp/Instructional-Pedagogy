title: "Motivation & demotivation"
---

## Lesson objectives

+ Identify authentic tasks and explain why teaching them is important
+ Demonstrate strategies for avoiding dismissive language
+ Develop strategies to avoid demotivating students

## Overview

Teaching and learning are not the same process. Considering what we talked 
about before regarding the limits of memory, we can make choices that 
facilitate the cognitive processes necessary for learning to occur. But any 
technique can fall flat when our students are not motivated. Worse, 
demotivation is contagious! Teaching or sharing a classroom with demotivated 
students is not fun or rewarding and it can be tempting to blame students for 
spoiling the classroom experience.

It is true motivation is influenced by many factors well beyond the control of 
an instructor, including individual background and systemic forces. However, 
there are many things you can do to cultivate motivation in your classroom, and 
perhaps most importantly, to avoid doing harm to your students' motivation.

We are going to talk about several ways that students can be motivated (or 
demotivated!) by instructional content and approaches, and provides practice 
opportunities for you to become confident in motivating your students.

Think back to courses you have taken and consider things that the instructor 
has said or done that you found motivating. Share your example in the 
collaborative document.

## Motivation

### Authentic tasks

People learn best when they care about a topic and believe they can master it 
with a reasonable investment of time and effort. Many scientists might 
appreciate the value of programming but believe that developing useful skills 
will take more time than they have available. This presents a problem because 
believing that something will be too hard to learn often becomes a 
self-fulfilling prophecy.

One way to combat this problem is to begin a lesson with something that is 
quick to learn and immediately useful. It is particularly important that 
students see it as useful in their daily work. This not only motivates them, it 
also helps build their confidence in us, so that if it takes longer to get to 
something they find useful in a later topic, they will persist with the lesson.

I saw a nice summary of this approach that was a riff off Michael Pollan's 
three simple rules for eating that goes something like:

1. Write good code
2. Not too much
3. Mostly plots

(the original rules were "Eat food, not too much, mostly plants.")

Imagine a graph whose axes are labeled "mean time to master" and "usefulness 
once mastered". Tasks that are quick to master and immediately useful should 
ideally be taught first; things in the opposite corner that are time-consuming 
to learn and have little near-term application should be avoided for short 
data science modules.

### Invite Participation

Motivation is supported by active engagement. Participation allows students to 
ask questions, which can resolve roadblocks quickly, and demonstrate knowledge, 
which helps build confidence. However, I think we have all experienced how many 
students will not immediately feel comfortable speaking up, especially when 
they feel confusion or doubt. Creating a motivating classroom means being 
explicit about inviting communication and reinforcing that invitation with an 
attentive response.

A few ways to invite participation are:

+ Establish norms for interaction. This can be done by creating procedures for 
communication, e.g. turn taking in discussions or encouraging quieter people to 
contribute. Having, discussing, and enforcing a class code of conduct also 
provides a framework for positive communication to occur.
+ Encouraging students to learn from each other. Working in pairs encourages 
students to talk through their learning process, reinforcing memory and making 
it more likely that confusion will be expressed and resolved. This can also 
address challenges of varying background experience: asking more advanced 
students to help beginners can maximize learning for both.
+ Acknowledging when students are confused. Acknowledging and exploring 
confusion with kindness rewards students for sharing vulnerable information. 
Furthermore, When students see that others are confused, they are more likely 
to share their own uncertainties.

instructor (this might be you!) has said or done that was demotivating. Share

### First, Do No Harm!

When learning a skill we develop opinions about tools and methods, and 
sometimes base a professional identity around displaying technical expertise. 
Technical boasts, insults, and other showy moves present serious hazards in the 
classroom! Here are a few things you should not do:

+ Talk contemptuously or with scorn about any tool or practice, or the people 
who use them. Regardless of its shortcomings, many of your students may be 
using that tool, and may have invested many years in learning to do so. 
Convincing someone to change their practices is much harder when they think 
that you disdain them.
+ Dive into complex or detailed technical discussion with the one or two people 
in the audience who clearly don't actually need to be there. Reserve those 
conversations for office hours or follow-up emails.
+ Pretend to know more than you do. People will actually trust you more if you 
are frank about the limitations of your knowledge, and will be more likely to 
ask questions and seek help. This is tough, because it is important that your 
students view you as qualified to teach the material, and we have probably all 
encountered precocial students (or faculty), who want to show how smart they 
are by tripping up the instructor. Nonetheless, be aware of where your limits 
are and don't hesistate to use the "I'll follow up on that" response.
+ Use the J word ("just") or other demotivating language. These signal to the 
student that the instructor thinks their problem is trivial and by extension 
that they therefore must be deficient if they are not able to figure it out. It 
is tempting to use this language in an effort to convince students that a task 
is as easy to learn as it is for _you_ to accomplish. Saying something like 
"Look, you just clone the repo locally, checkout a new branch, make the edit, 
commit, push, submit a PR and boom, you're done." in an introduction to GitHub
is likely going to have the opposite effect from what was intended. 
+ Take over the student's keyboard. It is rarely a good idea to type anything 
for your students. Doing so can be demotivating for the student (as it implies 
you don't think they can do it themselves or that you don't want to wait for 
them). It also wastes a valuable opportunity for your student to develop muscle 
memory and other skills that are essential for independent work.
+ Express surprise at unawareness. Saying things like "I can't believe you 
don't know X" or "You've never heard of Y?" signals to the student that they do 
not have some required pre-knowledge of the material you are teaching, that 
they don't belong in the class, and it may prevent them from asking questions 
in the future. (For more on this see the Recurse Center's 
[Social Rules](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sec-environment)).

It can be difficult to avoid these demotivators entirely. Some people are so 
used to complaining about certain tools that they initially fail to realize 
they're doing it while teaching. If you catch yourself doing this, you might 
find a way to walk it back, or consider how you might repair or improve your 
motivational efforts on your next interaction. Teaching yourself to avoid these 
types of comments takes practice, but is well worth the effort.

## Reflection

***

**Exercise**

Considering the actions we discussed to make classes a positive learning 
environment, what is one thing you could start, stop, or change in your 
teaching practice to create a more positive learning environment. If there is 
something you _want_ to change, but do not know how, add that to the 
collaborative document. If possible, discuss this as a group.
