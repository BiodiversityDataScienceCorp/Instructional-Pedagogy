+ Evaluate cognitive load associated with a learning task
+ Create a formative assessment that maximizes germane cognitive load
+ Describe strategies for teaching students with very different skill levels

## Overview

In this section, we will be learning more about human memory and how our this
understanding can help in effective teaching strategies. Specifically, how to 
remove unnecessary "load" in order to facilitate learning.

## From Last Time

As a reminder, the first few weeks of this workshop series are going to be
focused on the process of skills development. We consider this from the 
perspective of the student and identify best practices that we can use as 
instructors. Much of what we will talk about will have a desired outcome of 
building capacity and confidence in data and computational skills development, 
rather than memorizing specific tasks.

## The Limits of Memory

Learning involves memory. For our purposes, human memory can be divided into 
two different layers. The first is called long-term. It is where we store 
persistent information like our friends' names and our home address. It is 
essentially unbounded (barring injury or disease, we will die before it fills 
up) but it is slow to access.

Our second layer of memory is called short-term. This is the type of memory you 
use to actively think about things and is often called working memory. It is 
much faster, but also much smaller: like about 7 +/- 2 things! This is why 
phone numbers are typically 7 or 8 digits long: back when phones had dials 
instead of keypads, that was the longest sequence of numbers most adults could 
remember accurately for as long as it took the dial to go around and around.

If we present our students with large amounts of information, without giving 
them the opportunity to practice using it (and thereby transfer it into 
long-term memory), they will not retain the material as well as if we present 
small amounts of information interspersed with practice opportunities. This is 
yet another reason why going slowly and using frequent formative assessment is 
important.

## Strategies for memory management

Because short-term memory is limited, we can support students by not flooding 
their short term memory with too many separate pieces of information. Does this 
mean we should teach fewer concepts? Yes! However, this is not the _only_ 
approach to use. We can also assist by providing strategies and exercises to 
help them form the connections that will (a) support them in holding more 
things in short-term memory at once and (b) begin to consolidate some concepts, 
moving them into long-term memory.

**Formative assessment** is a key component in helping students solidify their 
understanding and begin transferring ideas into long-term memory. Why? Because 
it engages the brain in retrieving recently-learned information and actively 
applying it to solve a problem. This helps to both reinforce and connect that 
new information in useful ways.

The limitations of short-term memory are one reason why assessments should be 
frequent: short-term memory is limited not only in space, but also in time. If 
you wait too long before deploying a formative assessment, some of the 
information necessary to complete the task will already be forgotten. This time 
window can be very short, especially if a lot of content is being taught at 
once. Be sure to remind students about prior concepts essential to a task.

Elaboration, or explaining your work, supports transfer to long-term memory. 
This is one reason why teaching is one of the most effective ways to learn! 
**Group work** can feel uncomfortable at first and consumes time in class, 
but students often rate group work as a high point for both enjoyment and 
learning.

**Reflection** is another tool that can help students review things they have 
learned, strengthen connections between them, and consolidate long-term 
memories. Like formative assessment, asking students for feedback can double as 
both a source of information and an effective consolidating prompt, as 
providing feedback demands some reflection on what has been learned. We will 
talk more about methods for this in the next section. You may also wish to 
pause and allow students to write summary notes for themselves or otherwise ask 
them to review what they have learned at various points in the class session.

In the same vein as "going slowly," it is important to **limit the number of 
concepts** introduced in a class. This can be hard! As you are reviewing a 
lesson to teach, you will doubtless come across related concepts that are very 
useful, and you may feel strongly motivated to sneak them in. Planning your 
lesson with a concept map can help you not only identify key concepts and 
relationships, but also to notice when you are trying to teach too many things 
at once.

**Exercise**

Consider the strategies for memory management we just covered 
(formative assessments, group work, reflection opportunities, and limiting 
concepts) and either:

1. Provide an example of how you have used one of these strategies in your 
teaching experience; or
2. Describe how you might adopt one of these strategies to implement in your 
_future_ teaching practice

Add your answer to the collaborative document.

**Exercise**

Given what you have discussed about strategies for memory management, what are 
the primary _constraints_ to adopting the techniques we have discussed?

## Attention is a limited resource: Cognitive Load

Memory is not the only cognitive resource that is limited. Attention is 
constrained as well, which can limit the information that enters short term 
memory in the first place as well as interfere with attempts at consolidation. 
While many people believe that they can "multi-task," the reality is that 
attention can only focus on one thing at a time. Adding items that demand 
attention adds more things to alternate between attending to, which can reduce 
efficiency and performance on all of them.

### The Theory of Cognitive Load

There are different theories of cognitive load, but for our purposes, we will 
consider three things that students have in their heads while learning.

1. Things they have to think about in order to perform a task ("intrinsic")
2. Mental effort required to connect the task to new and old information 
("germane")
3. Distractions and other mental effort not directly related to performing or 
learning from the task ("extraneous")

Cognitive load is not always a bad thing! There is plenty of evidence that some 
difficulty is desirable and can increase learning. However, there are limits. 
Managing all forms of cognitive load, with particular attention to extraneous 
load, can help prevent cognitive overload from impeding learning altogether.

One way to manage cognitive load as tasks become more complex is by using 
guided practice: creating a structure that narrowly guides focus on specific 
skills and knowledge in a stepped fashion, with feedback at each step before 
transferring attention to a new feature.

### Attention management

The choices you make as an instructor may add to or subtract from your 
students' cognitive load. Supporting memory consolidation can reduce load later 
on in the class, as it reduces the effort of recalling forgotten material. You 
can also minimize cognitive load by choosing formative assessments that are 
narrowly focused and by considering potential distractions in what you display 
during instruction.

There are many different types of exercises that can focus attention narrowly 
and help to avoid cognitive overload. Carefully targeted multiple choice 
questions can play this role. A few more that you may wish to consider are:

+ **Faded examples**: worked examples with targeted details "faded" out - 
essentially fill-in-the-blank programming blocks. e.g. students would fill in 
the blank a for loop in R:

```
# Print square of i
for (i in 1:10) {
  i_squared <- _______
  cat(i, "^2 = ", i_squared)
}
```

+ **Parson's Problems**: out-of-order code selection & sorting challenges. e.g. 
students would rearrange the steps into the correct order for a differential 
gene expression workflow:
    + Sequence samples
    + Count number of reads per gene
    + Map sequences to genome
    + Identify differentially expressed genes
    + Trim adapters from sequences
+ **Labeling diagrams or flow charts**. For example, you could provide the concepts 
for the for loop in Python example and ask the students to draw lines between 
concepts and label the relationships.

Beware assessments that are too open-ended, as these are very likely to induce 
cognitive overload in novices. You may have experienced some overload already 
when you were asked to create a concept map; this is why we do not recommend 
these as an activity for novices. Questions that ask students to both remember 
and synthesize or reason with new information are also risky. If you try out a 
question and get a room filled with silence, you may need an icebreaker, you 
may need to re-teach... or you may only need a more narrowly focused question.

***

**Exercise**

Consider a topic you teach or might teach in one of your classes and create an 
assessment like the ones we described above (multiple choice questions, faded 
examples, Parson's problems, or diagram labeling). You can build off of the 
concept map you built previously, or choose a different topic. After creating 
this assessment, explain how you expect it to reinforce what you taught.

## Managing a diverse classroom

You will most often have students from a variety of backgrounds and with varied 
technical skill levels in the same classroom. Some may be novices in one 
technology, but competent or even expert in another. As an instructor, you will 
need to be attentive to this range in your students' prior skill level. 
This idea of "meeting students where they are" can be tough, but there are 
strategies to employ to ensure a positive learning experience for all.

**Exercise**

What are some of the challenges you might expect when teaching students with a 
broad range of expertise? How have you handled situations with different skill 
levels in your classroom? Are there situations you have yet to "solve"? Add 
your thoughts in the collaborative document.

***

Here are some strategies to deal with this issue:

+ Be sure that course advertisements communicate its level clearly by 
describing not only the topics, but also the specific skills and tasks (you can 
communicate this through your learning objectives, which we will talk about 
shortly).
+ During class, encourage students to help others when they feel comfortable 
doing so. Teaching is a great way to level up learning. Note that you may need 
an icebreaker before most students will take this advice.
+ Do not let advanced students take over the conversation during class, no 
matter how interesting it may be. This can alienate beginners and consumes 
precious time. Advanced questions and comments can be politely reserved for 
office hours.
+ If you have help in the class (teaching assistants, preceptors), these folks 
should be vigilant for students who are falling behind and intervene early so 
that they do not become frustrated and give up. Frequent reminders to your 
students to indicate their progress will support your team in targeting 
problems in time. We'll talk more about how to assess progress in a bit.

No class can possibly meet all individual training needs. However, it is 
entirely possible for total beginners and advanced students to come away happy 
from the same class. Beginners may not yet feel competent, but they may build a 
mental model of the domain and develop confidence that they can learn these 
skills because they have successfully walked through them. Advanced students 
may enjoy picking up "tips and tricks" or having their own self-taught 
approaches validated.

Dealing effectively with different skill levels does take some planning. 
However, with appropriate advertising and team cohesion on priorities and 
strategies, your workshop can be a worthwhile experience for everyone.

**Homework**

In the upcoming sessions, we will be focused on the classroom. We would like 
you to start thinking about topics you have taught or would like to teach that 
involve hands-on components to them. We will be using those topics to guide 
some the next set of exercises.
