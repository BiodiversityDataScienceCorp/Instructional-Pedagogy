## Motiviation & Demotivation

Teaching and learning are not the same process. Considering what we talked 
about before regarding the limits of memory, we can make choices that 
facilitate the cognitive processes necessary for learning to occur. But any 
technique can fall flat when our students are not motivated. Worse, 
demotivation is contagious! Teaching or sharing a classroom with demotivated 
students is not fun or rewarding and it can be tempting to blame students for 
spoiling the classroom experience.

It is true motivation is influenced by many factors well beyond the control of 
an instructor, including individual background and systemic forces. However, 
there are many things you can do to cultivate motivation in your classroom, and 
perhaps most importantly, to avoid doing harm to your students' motivation.

We are going to talk about several ways that students can be motivated (or 
demotivated!) by instructional content and approaches, and provides practice 
opportunities for you to become confident in motivating your students.

**Exercise**: Think back to courses you have taken and consider things that the 
instructor has said or done that you found motivating. Share your example in 
the collaborative document.

### Motivation

#### Authentic tasks

People learn best when they care about a topic and believe they can master it 
with a reasonable investment of time and effort. Many scientists might 
appreciate the value of programming but believe that developing useful skills 
will take more time than they have available. This presents a problem because 
believing that something will be too hard to learn often becomes a 
self-fulfilling prophecy.

One way to combat this problem is to begin a lesson with something that is 
quick to learn and immediately useful. It is particularly important that 
learners see it as useful in their daily work. This not only motivates them, it 
also helps build their confidence in us, so that if it takes longer to get to 
something they find useful in a later topic, they will persist with the lesson.

I saw a nice summary of this approach that was a riff off Michael Pollan's 
three simple rules for eating that goes something like:

1. Write good code
2. Not too much
3. Mostly plots

(the original rules were "Eat food, not too much, mostly plants.")

Imagine a graph whose axes are labeled "mean time to master" and "usefulness 
once mastered". Tasks that are quick to master and immediately useful should 
ideally be taught first; things in the opposite corner that are time-consuming 
to learn and have little near-term application should be avoided for short 
data science modules.

#### Invite Participation

Motivation is supported by active engagement. Participation allows students to 
ask questions, which can resolve roadblocks quickly, and demonstrate knowledge, 
which helps build confidence. However, I think we have all experienced how many 
students will not immediately feel comfortable speaking up, especially when 
they feel confusion or doubt. Creating a motivating classroom means being 
explicit about inviting communication and reinforcing that invitation with an 
attentive response.

A few ways to invite participation are:

+ Establish norms for interaction. This can be done by creating procedures for 
communication, e.g. turn taking in discussions or encouraging quieter people to 
contribute. Having, discussing, and enforcing a class code of conduct also 
provides a framework for positive communication to occur.
+ Encouraging students to learn from each other. Working in pairs encourages 
students to talk through their learning process, reinforcing memory and making 
it more likely that confusion will be expressed and resolved. This can also 
address challenges of varying background experience: asking more advanced 
students to help beginners can maximize learning for both.
+ Acknowledging when students are confused. Acknowledging and exploring 
confusion with kindness rewards students for sharing vulnerable information. 
Furthermore, When students see that others are confused, they are more likely 
to share their own uncertainties.

### Demotivation

**Exercise**: Think back to courses you have taken or taught and consider 
things that the instructor has said or done that was demotivating. Share your 
example in the collaborative document.

#### First, Do No Harm!

When learning a skill we develop opinions about tools and methods, and 
sometimes base a professional identity around displaying technical expertise. 
Technical boasts, insults, and other showy moves present serious hazards in the 
classroom! Here are a few things you should not do:

+ Talk contemptuously or with scorn about any tool or practice, or the people 
who use them. Regardless of its shortcomings, many of your students may be 
using that tool, and may have invested many years in learning to do so. 
Convincing someone to change their practices is much harder when they think 
that you disdain them.
+ Dive into complex or detailed technical discussion with the one or two people 
in the audience who clearly don't actually need to be there. Reserve those 
conversations for office hours or follow-up emails.
+ Pretend to know more than you do. People will actually trust you more if you 
are frank about the limitations of your knowledge, and will be more likely to 
ask questions and seek help. This is tough, because it is important that your 
students view you as qualified to teach the material, and we have probably all 
encountered precocial students (or faculty), who want to show how smart they 
are by tripping up the instructor. Nonetheless, be aware of where your limits 
are and don't hesistate to use the "I'll follow up on that" response.
+ Use the J word ("just") or other demotivating language. These signal to the 
learner that the instructor thinks their problem is trivial and by extension 
that they therefore must be deficient if they are not able to figure it out. It 
is tempting to use this language in an effort to convince students that a task 
is as easy to learn as it is for _you_ to accomplish. Saying something like 
"Look, you just clone the repo locally, checkout a new branch, make the edit, 
commit, push, submit a PR and boom, you're done." in an introduction to GitHub
is likely going to have the opposite effect from what was intended. 
+ Take over the student's keyboard. It is rarely a good idea to type anything 
for your students. Doing so can be demotivating for the learner (as it implies 
you don't think they can do it themselves or that you don't want to wait for 
them). It also wastes a valuable opportunity for your learner to develop muscle 
memory and other skills that are essential for independent work.
+ Express surprise at unawareness. Saying things like "I can't believe you 
don't know X" or "You've never heard of Y?" signals to the student that they do 
not have some required pre-knowledge of the material you are teaching, that 
they don't belong in the class, and it may prevent them from asking questions 
in the future. (For more on this see the Recurse Center's 
[Social Rules](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sec-environment)).

It can be difficult to avoid these demotivators entirely. Some people are so 
used to complaining about certain tools that they initially fail to realize 
they're doing it while teaching. If you catch yourself doing this, you might 
find a way to walk it back, or consider how you might repair or improve your 
motivational efforts on your next interaction. Teaching yourself to avoid these 
types of comments takes practice, but is well worth the effort.

## Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility

As we have seen, there are many teaching practices that can make your class 
more positive and welcoming. However, no class occurs in a vacuum: everyone's 
experiences begin and end and are influenced by the world beyond. In this 
section we will discuss some of the systemic barriers that can result in 
members of some groups being excluded even in an otherwise welcoming 
environment. The fact that some groups face barriers that others do not means 
we cannot take a one size fits all approach to creating a positive learning 
environment.

### Definitions

This section addresses topics related to equity, inclusion, and accessibility. 
These terms are increasingly common and may be familiar to you, but not 
everyone understands or interprets them in the same way. So, we will start with 
a few working definitions, adapted from the University of Pittsburgh DEI 
Glossary:

**Equity**: The proportional distribution of desirable outcomes across groups. 
Sometimes confused with equality, equity refers to outcomes while equality 
connotes equal treatment.

**Inclusion**: Actively engaging traditionally excluded individuals and/or 
groups in processes, activities and decisions in a way that shares power. 
Inclusion promotes broad engagement, shared participation, and advances 
authentic sense of belonging through safe, positive, and nurturing 
environments.

**Accessibility**: Refers to the intentional design or redesign of technology, 
policies, products, and services (to name a few) that increase one's ability to 
use, access, and obtain the respective item. Each person is afforded the 
opportunity to acquire the same information, engage in the same interactions, 
and enjoy the same services in an equally effective and equally integrated 
manner, with substantially equivalent ease of use.

### Equity versus Equality

We can monitor our own use of stereotypes, but the experiences that people have 
before and after our classes are beyond our control. Because these experiences 
are unequal, including historical and present-day differences in access to 
resources, mentorship, and other avenues towards career success, we should aim 
to make students' experiences _equitable_. This means that, rather than 
offering the same access and experience to all, we should craft our instruction
to actively counter-balance unequal opportunities that have led to 
disproportionate representation of certain groups in data-centric careers. In 
doing this, we focus on increasing accessibility and acknowledging and, when 
possible, countering systemic biases.

### Accessibility and universal design

Accommodation means changing things to serve an individual with a demonstrated 
need. However, accommodation puts the onus on the individual with the need to 
have to disclose their disability and ask for accommodations. Reluctance to do 
so is understandable: requests for accommodation are often met with negative 
emotions such as uncertainity, confusion, annoyance or anger by those receiving 
the requests.

By contrast, "universal design" means creating something to be maximally usable 
by all people without additional changes. A good example of universal design is 
curb cuts and sidewalk ramps. While they were originally created to make it 
easier for wheelchair users to move around, they proved to be equally helpful 
to people with strollers and grocery carts.

Universal design places responsibility for accessibility on the course designer 
rather than on the learner. It states that the most inclusive approach to 
education is to design instruction with diverse learners in mind from the 
beginning.

It’s easy to be overwhelmed by all the different ways we could make instruction 
more accessible. A couple things to remember:

+ It is ok not to do everything at once. Try to build in accessibility habits 
when preparing for workshops through reflective practice, adding something new 
each time.
+ Do the easy things first. There are plenty of ways to make workshops more 
accessible that are both quick to accomplish and minimal in demands on 
attention: font choices, text size, checking in advance that your room is 
accessible via an elevator or ramp, etc.

**Exercise**: What is one thing you could do in your classes to improve 
accessibility? What is one thing you would like to do, but you don't know how 
or are prevented from doing so by external factors? Add your answers to the 
collaborative document.

### Systemic bias

As instructors, many aspects of our classroom environment are within our 
control or influence. However, the world is a complicated place, and there will 
always be extraneous factors that contribute to demotivation and add to 
cognitive load. These vary from person to person, but members of certain groups 
often carry a heavier load due to systemic forces that disproportionately 
impact them. What we can control, in this case, is our own awareness of the 
challenges these forces present to teaching and learning. As with other 
demotivation pitfalls, we can also think carefully about the language that we 
use and how we interact with our learners to avoid reinforcing systemic bias.

#### Stereotypes

We all use stereotypes, and for good reason. They serve a cognitive purpose. 
One study suggests we encounter more than 34 gigabytes of information every 
day. That is more information than we could ever process, so our brains use 
shortcuts. What an expert thing to do! Stereotypes are one of those shortcuts. 
As with other models, they are all wrong, but some are dangerous. What are 
stereotypes?

Stereotypes are an established feature of human social cognition, in which a 
set of characteristics is associated with members of a group. Sterotypes:

+ may be explicit (conscious and deliberate) or implicit (unconscious and 
  automatic)
+ guide what we notice about people
+ guide how we interpret people’s behaviors
+ can facilitate quick judgments in appropriate situations (e.g. stopping a 
  child from driving a car)
+ can lead to systematically negative attitudes and behaviors towards members 
of certain groups

Stereotypes are dangerous when they are explicit, but they are especially 
hazardous when they are implicit. This means that the people holding them may 
not be aware of them, even though their perceptions are guided by them.

When instructors have stereotypes about students, this may lead them to:

+ call attention to differences unnecessarily
+ give more or less attention to certain learners
+ respond to questions differently for certain learners

When students experience stereotypes about themselves, they may:

+ develop a fixed mindset about aspects of their own capability
+ experience increased cognitive load when reminded about a stereotype, 
interfering with the learning process. This is known as _stereotype threat_.

What can we do about our own stereotypes? Most importantly, we can become aware 
of them. This isn't something that often happens overnight, but some steps you 
can take are:

+ Get to know people from many different groups!
+ Observe your own behavior, and build awareness of situations in which your 
perceptions and behaviors are influenced by stereotypes.
+ Avoid calling attention to common stereotypes, even in a way that seems 
positive.

## Reflection

**Exercise**: Considering the actions we discussed to make classes a positive 
learning environment, what is one thing you could start, stop, or change in 
your teaching practice to create a more positive learning environment. (Maybe 
a good breakout room opportunity?) If there is something you _want_ to change, 
but do not know how, add that to the collaborative document.

**TODO**: Add homework here. Perhaps being prepared to teach from one of their 
own classes. Can provide some Carpentries materials for those who do not have 
material for hands-on stuff yet.

**Feedback** Doing one-up-down? Have Google form for anonymous feedback.
