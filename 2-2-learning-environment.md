# The learning environment

## Objectives

+ Identify authentic tasks and explain why teaching them is important
+ Demonstrate strategies for avoiding dismissive language
+ Develop strategies to avoid demotivating learners
+ Identify instructional strategies that are consistent with universal design
+ Recognize systemic factors that can distract and demotivate learners


## Motiviation & Demotivation

### Authetic tasks

### Language

We want to motivate students and we will talk more about motivation in a later 
session. But here, we will take a moment to recognize one ineffective strategy 
often deployed by experts who want learners to believe that a task is as easy 
as they think it is. This often manifests in using the word "just" in 
explanations, as in, "Look, it is easy, you just... (wave magic wand with 
undecipherable incantations)" This language gives learners the very clear 
signal that the person helping them thinks their problem is trivial and that 
there must be something wrong with them if they do not experience it that way.

With practice, we can change the way we speak to avoid dismissive language and 
replace it with more positive and motivating word choices.

**TODO**: Maybe an exercise here?

### Demotivation

## Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility

### Universal design

### Systemic bias

## Reflection
