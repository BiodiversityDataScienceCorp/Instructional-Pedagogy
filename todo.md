# Areas to address or fix

+ Will want to be consistent with objectives/outcomes. Would be good to have 
input from others on this.
+ Be sure to replace "learners" with "students" throughout
+ Check header levels
+ Assign homework at end of each day
+ Be consistent with "collaborative document"
+ Add "Next" and "Previous" links among lessons
+ Consider some formatting to make Exercises stand out from other content; 
could use `div` tags along with a CSS style of the background-color attribute.
+ Add an index.md page
