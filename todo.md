# Areas to address or fix

+ Will want to be consistent with objectives/outcomes. Would be good to have 
input from others on this.
+ Set up collaborative document
+ Be sure to replace "learners" with "students" throughout
+ Check header levels
+ Assign homework at end of each day?
+ Be consistent with "collaborative document"
+ Add "Next" and "Previous" links among lessons
+ Consider some formatting to make Exercises stand out from other content

## Needs 2022-05-16

+ Session 1
    + Timing seems a bit off. Is Module 2 really two days (4 hours) worth of 
    material? Maybe 3-1, or part of it needs to go into 2-2?
+ Module 1
    + 1-1
        + Introduction - need any additional information
        + Participant assessment of experience with data science in classroom
        + Add high-level Schedule (and breaktimes and office hours)
        + Add high-level topics to be covered (maybe part of Schedule?)
            + Be sure to address what isn't going to be covered, or make an 
            opening for what stuff folks want to learn (R, GitHub, Binder, 
            RMarkdown?)
        + Talk a little about format (lecture + exercises)
        + Simplified code of conduct
    + 1-2

        + Exercise with concept map needs more explanation
        + Describe how mental model (the example for the concept map, above) 
        can be broken
        + Figure out end of day feedback
    + 1-3
        + An exercise about memory management
        + Examples for types of formative assessment (faded examples, Parson's 
        problems, diagram labeling)
        + Exercise about congitive load or attention management: Ask for one of 
        the assessment examples (Faded example, Parson's problem, labeling 
        diagram) on their concept map
        + Add homework for 2-1
        + Figure out end of day feedback
+ Module 2
    + 2-1
        + Exercise to reflect on Module 1

    + 2-2
    + 2-3
        + Add homework for 3-1, something about having material ready to teach 
        in Module 3 (see Exercise in 3-1)
        + Figure out end of day feedback
        + Consider adding more exercises - this episode is pretty light on
