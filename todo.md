# Areas to address or fix

+ Will want to be consistent with objectives/outcomes. Would be good to have 
input from others on this.
+ Check header levels
+ Be consistent with "collaborative document"

## Needs 2022-05-16

+ Session 1
    + Timing seems a bit off. Is Module 2 really two days (4 hours) worth of 
    material? Maybe 3-1, or part of it needs to go into 2-2?
+ Module 1
    + 1-1
        + Introduction - need any additional information?
    + 1-2
    + 1-3
+ Module 2
    + 2-1
    + 2-2
    + 2-3
        + Consider adding more exercises - this episode is pretty light on 
        interactivity
+ Module 3
    + 3-1
    + 3-2
    + 3-3
        + Need to wrap up and look ahead to session 2
