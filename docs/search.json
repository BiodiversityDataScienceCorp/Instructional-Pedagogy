    "text": "Reverse instructional design\nBackward design is an instructional design model that starts with identifying the desired outcomes of a learning experience, including core skills and concepts that students need to acquire. These identified outcomes are used to develop course content and assessments to measure students’ progress towards these outcomes.\nIn essence, the backward design process has three stages:\n\nIdentify the practical skills we aim to teach.\nDesign formative assessments to give an opportunity for our students to practice and integrate these skills.\nIdentify what we need to teach for our students to acquire these skills.\n\nThis approach ensures that all the skills you teach work together to meet the over-arching goals of your curriculum. It also reduces the risk that you won’t teach a concept students need in order to be able to master the skills you aim to teach. Similarly, it avoids teaching topics that do not help you (and your students) meet our goals.\nReducing distractions is part of our lesson design as we strive to reduce cognitive load on students. To this end, we will also talk about how to develop lessons centered around a narrative and a data set students can relate with quickly.\n\nExercise\nIn groups, describe the data science module you would like to deploy in your classroom. Start by sharing the course you will teach the module in, then the audience for the module (i.e. who the students are). Then provide a general description of the tool or resource you want to teach your students.\nProvide feedback to other group members on their ideas. Some things to consider: in the spirit of “teach the most useful first”, how does this idea fit? What what is the knowledge or skills that students will need to bring to this lesson (this is that “intrinsic” cognitive load we talked about).\n\n\nPractical skills\nWe emphasize teaching “good enough practices” - concrete skills that are accessible and likely to make an immediate positive impact on students’ work. Teaching defensive programming, how to use spreadsheets effectively, or how to organize files consistently across research projects, are practical skills that can save a lot time when students apply them in their own work.\nWhen developing a new module, the first step is to identify the skills that will be the most immediately useful to students and have the biggest impact on their work. This will vary a lot, so having a clear idea of your lesson’s intended audience is critical at this stage.\n\nExercise\nBased on the discussions you had with your group, take a few minutes to list the skills you want your students to come away with after completing the class module. Add this list of skills to the collaborative document.\n\n\n\n\nImage credit: Vanderbilt University Center for Teaching\n\n\n\nExercise\nNow, looking at those skills, revise them so they are learning objectives. Consider where on Bloom’s taxonomy those learning objectives would be. Add the learning objectives to the collaborative document.\n\n\n\nDesigning assessments\nOnce you have identified these high-impact skills, the lesson content should be designed to create frequent opportunities for students to practice these skills while exemplifying the tasks they perform in their daily work. Live coding and hands-on formative assessments that students can directly relate to should allow them to envision how they can start using the skills taught with their own data as soon as the class session is over.\nIn much of traditional Western instruction, students are presented with new material during course time and then sent home to practice applying the concepts learned on their own. A major limitation of this approach is that students often encounter difficulties in trying to apply their new knowledge or skills and need to troubleshoot on their own, without support. Education research shows that novices learn best when they are given feedback and coaching in real time while practicing their new skills so that errors are corrected and missteps redirected before mistakes have a chance to become discouraging or ingrained in students’ memory.\nTo this end, we should provide frequent opportunities for students to practice new skills. To be helpful in providing useful feedback, these opportunities need to both be:\n\nnarrowly targeted to the skills that have been taught (i.e. not to depend on untaught concepts), and;\ndiagnostic (instructors should be able to tell what the student is misunderstanding based on how they answer the question).\n\n\nExercise\nPick one of your learning objectives from above and design an assessment for you as an instructor to assess how well the student understands the concept being taught. Remember to make the assessment:\n\nNarrowly targeted to the skills that have been taught\nDiagnostic to provide you information on potential misconceptions\n\nWhen you have finished drafting the assessment, add it to the collaborative document.\n\n\nExercise\nNow share your learning objective and the accompanying assessment with your group. Taking turns, review your peers’ assessments addressing these two questions:\n\nIs the assessment narrow enough to focus on the skills being taught?\nAre there additional misconceptions that might be caught?\n\n\nThis is the start, and we will have more time to write assessments for your learning objectives. Also note that your list of skills and learning objectives can change as you develop your lesson.\n\n\nDesigning assessments\nThe assessments in a lesson should be a mixture of direct applications and synthesis. A direct application is a straightforward implementation of a concept that students have just been exposed to, while synthesis requires students to integrate recently learned skills with skills that were covered earlier in the lesson. Learning is reinforced when you explicitly point out how the skills seen in earlier parts of the lesson are being integrated in the assessments.\nFormative assessments help students further their learning by having a chance to put into practice the skills being taught. They also help you monitor the level of understanding in the classroom, and potentially catch misconceptions in the student’s mental models that can be corrected in real time, before they become ingrained.\nWhen starting to design assessments, it is helpful to start by planning the last exercise of the class. This will help you keep the big picture in mind and ensure that the rest of the exercises you develop lead up to this larger goal. These final assessments are also the most likely to be “unscaffolded”, and so are easier to develop without detailed knowledge of the various types of exercises we will discuss later. Such a final assessment may include an assessment of multiple (or even all) of the learning objectives for your lesson.\n\nExercise\nDraft a final assessment to assess some or all of the learning objectives you listed in the previous exercise. This can be more open-ended than some of the formative assessments we have talked about previously, but don’t leave your students confused about what they are supposed to do. e.g. “Describe evolution” might be a bit to vague. It may not necessarily be something that would take place synchronously (i.e. it could be homework) or during the same class period (i.e. group work during the next class).\n\n\nExercise\nBased on this overarching assessment, have a neighbor draw a concept map of the concepts and connections that are required for this assessment. Are there things in the concept map that you missed?\n\n\nHomework\nNext time you will have time for writing more assessments for learning objectives. Remember, the list of skills and learning objectives you wrote earlier are not set in stone! For next time, think about how you might revise your objectives based on the peer feedback you received today."

    "text": "Why Participatory Live Coding?\nWe talk about the practice of “live coding”. However, you are not live coding in a vacuum. Importantly, students are strongly encouraged to “code-along” with you. We refer to the practice of having the instructor live code and the students code along as “participatory live coding” or, less formally, as “code-along sessions”.\n\nExercise\nList some advantages and challenges of participatory live coding from both a student’s and an instructor’s point of view in the collaborative document or discuss with your group.\n\nLive coding fits well into the model we have been discussing - by providing students with continuous opportunities for practice (every time they type in a line of code) and continuous feedback (their code either works or fails with an error message). It is important to keep in mind, however, that feedback is not helpful if you cannot understand it. Many error messages are obscure and not written with novices in mind. With this in mind, if you are doing live coding and make an error, it is an especially good opportunity to explain to your students how you go about addressing the error. It is totally OK to include Googling for the answer as on of your steps (but maybe not the first step you take).\n\nExercise\nWatch this first participatory live coding demo video: https://youtu.be/bXxBeNkKmJE and this second demo video: https://youtu.be/SkPmwe_WjeY and then summarize your feedback on both in the collaborative document. Use the 2x2 (positive/negative, content/presentation) rubric for feedback we discussed earlier.\n\nIn the videos, the instructor is teaching students how to use loops to repeat as task.\nNote: Sometime sounds in the room can be poor. Turning on closed captioning by pressing the cc button will improve the accessibility of these videos."

Use a microphone if one is available to make it easier for people with hearing difficulties to hear you.\nGo slowly. For every command you type, every word of code you write, every menu item or website button you click, say out loud what you are doing while you do it. Then point to the command and its output on the screen and go through it a second time. This slows you down and allows students to copy what you do, or to catch up. Do not copy-paste code.\nMirror your students’ environment. Try to create an environment that is as similar as possible to what your students have to reduce cognitive load. Avoid using keyboard shortcuts.\nUse your screen wisely. Use a big font, and maximize the window. A black font on a white background works better than a light font on a dark background.\nUse illustrations to help students understand and organize the material. You can also generate the illustrations on the board as you progress through the material. This allows you to build up diagrams, making them increasingly complex in parallel with the material you are teaching. It helps students understand the material, makes for a more lively workshop and gathers the students’ attention to you as well.\nLeave no student behind. We will talk later in the workshop how sticky notes can be used to gauge students’ progress and understanding.\nEmbrace mistakes. No matter how well prepared you are, you will make mistakes. This is OK! Use these opportunities to do error framing and to help your students learn the art of troubleshooting.\nHave fun! It is OK to use humor and improvisation to liven up the workshop. This becomes easier when you are more familiar with the material, and more relaxed. Start small, even just saying ‘that was fun’ after something worked well or you fixed an error is a good start."

These terms are increasingly common and may be familiar to you, but not everyone understands or interprets them in the same way. So, we will start with a few working definitions, adapted from the University of Pittsburgh DEI Glossary:\nEquity: The proportional distribution of desirable outcomes across groups. Sometimes confused with equality, equity refers to outcomes while equality connotes equal treatment.\nInclusion: Actively engaging traditionally excluded individuals and/or groups in processes, activities and decisions in a way that shares power. Inclusion promotes broad engagement, shared participation, and advances authentic sense of belonging through safe, positive, and nurturing environments.\nAccessibility: Refers to the intentional design or redesign of technology, policies, products, and services (to name a few) that increase one’s ability to use, access, and obtain the respective item. Each person is afforded the opportunity to acquire the same information, engage in the same interactions, and enjoy the same services in an equally effective and equally integrated manner, with substantially equivalent ease of use.\n\nEquity versus Equality\nWe can monitor our own use of stereotypes, but the experiences that people have before and after our classes are beyond our control. Because these experiences are unequal, including historical and present-day differences in access to resources, mentorship, and other avenues towards career success, we should aim to make students’ experiences equitable. This means that, rather than offering the same access and experience to all, we should craft our instruction to actively counter-balance unequal opportunities that have led to disproportionate representation of certain groups in data-centric careers. In doing this, we focus on increasing accessibility and acknowledging and, when possible, countering systemic biases."

However, accommodation puts the onus on the individual with the need to have to disclose their disability and ask for accommodations. Reluctance to do so is understandable: requests for accommodation are often met with negative emotions such as uncertainity, confusion, annoyance or anger by those receiving the requests.\nBy contrast, “universal design” means creating something to be maximally usable by all people without additional changes. A good example of universal design is curb cuts and sidewalk ramps. While they were originally created to make it easier for wheelchair users to move around, they proved to be equally helpful to people with strollers and grocery carts.\nUniversal design places responsibility for accessibility on the course designer rather than on the learner. It states that the most inclusive approach to education is to design instruction with diverse students in mind from the beginning.\nIt’s easy to be overwhelmed by all the different ways we could make instruction more accessible. A couple things to remember:\n\nIt is ok not to do everything at once. Try to build in accessibility habits when preparing for workshops through reflective practice, adding something new each time.\nDo the easy things first. There are plenty of ways to make workshops more accessible that are both quick to accomplish and minimal in demands on attention: font choices, text size, checking in advance that your room is accessible via an elevator or ramp, etc.\n\n\nExercise\nWhat is one thing you could do in your classes to improve accessibility?

    "text": "Systemic bias\nAs instructors, many aspects of our classroom environment are within our control or influence. However, the world is a complicated place, and there will always be extraneous factors that contribute to demotivation and add to cognitive load. These vary from person to person, but members of certain groups often carry a heavier load due to systemic forces that disproportionately impact them. What we can control, in this case, is our own awareness of the challenges these forces present to teaching and learning. As with other demotivation pitfalls, we can also think carefully about the language that we use and how we interact with our students to avoid reinforcing systemic bias.\n\nStereotypes\nWe all use stereotypes, and for good reason. They serve a cognitive purpose. One study suggests we encounter more than 34 gigabytes of information every day. That is more information than we could ever process, so our brains use shortcuts. What an expert thing to do! Stereotypes are one of those shortcuts. As with other models, they are all wrong, but some are dangerous. What are stereotypes?\nStereotypes are an established feature of human social cognition, in which a set of characteristics is associated with members of a group. Sterotypes:\n\nmay be explicit (conscious and deliberate) or implicit (unconscious and automatic)\nguide what we notice about people\nguide how we interpret people’s behaviors\ncan facilitate quick judgments in appropriate situations (e.g. stopping a child from driving a car)\ncan lead to systematically negative attitudes and behaviors towards members of certain groups\n\nStereotypes are dangerous when they are explicit, but they are especially hazardous when they are implicit. This means that the people holding them may not be aware of them, even though their perceptions are guided by them.\nWhen instructors have stereotypes about students, this may lead them to:\n\ncall attention to differences unnecessarily\ngive more or less attention to certain students\nrespond to questions differently for certain students\n\nWhen students experience stereotypes about themselves, they may:\n\ndevelop a fixed mindset about aspects of their own capability\nexperience increased cognitive load when reminded about a stereotype, interfering with the learning process. This is known as stereotype threat.\n\nWhat can we do about our own stereotypes? Most importantly, we can become aware of them. This isn’t something that often happens overnight, but some steps you can take are:\n\nGet to know people from many different groups!\nObserve your own behavior, and build awareness of situations in which your perceptions and behaviors are influenced by stereotypes.\nAvoid calling attention to common stereotypes, even in a way that seems positive."

Specifically, how to remove unnecessary “load” in order to facilitate learning.\nLearning involves memory. For our purposes, human memory can be divided into two different layers. The first is called long-term. It is where we store persistent information like our friends’ names and our home address. It is essentially unbounded (barring injury or disease, we will die before it fills up) but it is slow to access.\nOur second layer of memory is called short-term. This is the type of memory you use to actively think about things and is often called working memory. It is much faster, but also much smaller: like about 7 +/- 2 things! This is why phone numbers are typically 7 or 8 digits long: back when phones had dials instead of keypads, that was the longest sequence of numbers most adults could remember accurately for as long as it took the dial to go around and around.\nIf we present our students with large amounts of information, without giving them the opportunity to practice using it (and thereby transfer it into long-term memory), they will not retain the material as well as if we present small amounts of information interspersed with practice opportunities. This is yet another reason why going slowly and using frequent formative assessment is important.\n\nExercise\nThis website implements a short test of working memory: https://miku.github.io/activememory/.

    "text": "Strategies for memory management\nBecause short-term memory is limited, we can support students by not flooding their short term memory with too many separate pieces of information. Does this mean we should teach fewer concepts? Yes! However, this is not the only approach to use. We can also assist by providing strategies and exercises to help them form the connections that will (a) support them in holding more things in short-term memory at once and (b) begin to consolidate some concepts, moving them into long-term memory.\nFormative assessment is a key component in helping students solidify their understanding and begin transferring ideas into long-term memory. Why? Because it engages the brain in retrieving recently-learned information and actively applying it to solve a problem. This helps to both reinforce and connect that new information in useful ways.\nThe limitations of short-term memory are one reason why assessments should be frequent: short-term memory is limited not only in space, but also in time. If you wait too long before deploying a formative assessment, some of the information necessary to complete the task will already be forgotten. This time window can be very short, especially if a lot of content is being taught at once. Be sure to remind students about prior concepts essential to a task.\nElaboration, or explaining your work, supports transfer to long-term memory. This is one reason why teaching is one of the most effective ways to learn! Group work can feel uncomfortable at first and consumes time in class, but students often rate group work as a high point for both enjoyment and learning.\nReflection is another tool that can help students review things they have learned, strengthen connections between them, and consolidate long-term memories. Like formative assessment, asking students for feedback can double as both a source of information and an effective consolidating prompt, as providing feedback demands some reflection on what has been learned. We will talk more about methods for this in the next section. You may also wish to pause and allow students to write summary notes for themselves or otherwise ask them to review what they have learned at various points in the class session.\nIn the same vein as “going slowly,” it is important to limit the number of concepts introduced in a class. This can be hard! As you are reviewing a lesson to teach, you will doubtless come across related concepts that are very useful, and you may feel strongly motivated to sneak them in. Planning your lesson with a concept map can help you not only identify key concepts and relationships, but also to notice when you are trying to teach too many things at once.\n\nExercise\nConsider the strategies for memory management we just covered (formative assessments, group work, reflection opportunities, and limiting concepts) and either:\n\nProvide an example of how you have used one of these strategies in your teaching experience; or\nDescribe how you might adopt one of these strategies to implement in your future teaching practice\n\nAdd your answer to the collaborative document.\n\nExercise\nGiven what you have discussed about strategies for memory management, what are the primary constraints to adopting the techniques we have discussed?"

    "text": "Attention is a limited resource: Cognitive Load\nMemory is not the only cognitive resource that is limited. Attention is constrained as well, which can limit the information that enters short term memory in the first place as well as interfere with attempts at consolidation. While many people believe that they can “multi-task,” the reality is that attention can only focus on one thing at a time. Adding items that demand attention adds more things to alternate between attending to, which can reduce efficiency and performance on all of them.\n\nThe Theory of Cognitive Load\nThere are different theories of cognitive load, but for our purposes, we will consider three things that students have in their heads while learning.\n\nThings they have to think about in order to perform a task (“intrinsic”)\nMental effort required to connect the task to new and old information (“germane”)\nDistractions and other mental effort not directly related to performing or learning from the task (“extraneous”)\n\nCognitive load is not always a bad thing! There is plenty of evidence that some difficulty is desirable and can increase learning. However, there are limits. Managing all forms of cognitive load, with particular attention to extraneous load, can help prevent cognitive overload from impeding learning altogether.\nOne way to manage cognitive load as tasks become more complex is by using guided practice: creating a structure that narrowly guides focus on specific skills and knowledge in a stepped fashion, with feedback at each step before transferring attention to a new feature.\n\n\nAttention management\nThe choices you make as an instructor may add to or subtract from your students’ cognitive load. Supporting memory consolidation can reduce load later on in the class, as it reduces the effort of recalling forgotten material. You can also minimize cognitive load by choosing formative assessments that are narrowly focused and by considering potential distractions in what you display during instruction.\nThere are many different types of exercises that can focus attention narrowly and help to avoid cognitive overload. Carefully targeted multiple choice questions can play this role. A few more that you may wish to consider are:\n\nFaded examples: worked examples with targeted details “faded” out - essentially fill-in-the-blank programming blocks. e.g. students would fill in the blank a for loop in R:\n\n# Print square of i\nfor (i in 1:10) {\n  i_squared <- _______\n  cat(i, \"^2 = \", i_squared)\n}\n\nParson’s Problems: out-of-order code selection & sorting challenges. e.g.  students would rearrange the steps into the correct order for a differential gene expression workflow:\n\nSequence samples\nCount number of reads per gene\nMap sequences to genome\nIdentify differentially expressed genes\nTrim adapters from sequences\n\nLabeling diagrams or flow charts. For example, you could provide the concepts for the for loop in Python example and ask the students to draw lines between concepts and label the relationships.\n\n\n\n\nConcepts of a Python for loop\n\n\nBeware assessments that are too open-ended, as these are very likely to induce cognitive overload in novices. You may have experienced some overload already when you were asked to create a concept map; this is why we do not recommend these as an activity for novices. Questions that ask students to both remember and synthesize or reason with new information are also risky. If you try out a question and get a room filled with silence, you may need an icebreaker, you may need to re-teach… or you may only need a more narrowly focused question.\n\nExercise\nConsider a topic you teach or might teach in one of your classes and create an assessment like the ones we described above (multiple choice questions, faded examples, Parson’s problems, or diagram labeling). You can build off of the concept map you built previously, or choose a different topic. After creating this assessment, explain how you expect it to reinforce what you taught."

    "text": "Managing a diverse classroom\nYou will most often have students from a variety of backgrounds and with varied technical skill levels in the same classroom. Some may be novices in one technology, but competent or even expert in another. As an instructor, you will need to be attentive to this range in your students’ prior skill level. This idea of “meeting students where they are” can be tough, but there are strategies to employ to ensure a positive learning experience for all.\n\nExercise\nWhat are some of the challenges you might expect when teaching students with a broad range of expertise? How have you handled situations with different skill levels in your classroom? Are there situations you have yet to “solve”? Add your thoughts in the collaborative document.\n\nHere are some strategies to deal with this issue:\n\nBe sure that course advertisements communicate its level clearly by describing not only the topics, but also the specific skills and tasks (you can communicate this through your learning objectives, which we will talk about shortly).\nDuring class, encourage students to help others when they feel comfortable doing so. Teaching is a great way to level up learning. Note that you may need an icebreaker before most students will take this advice.\nDo not let advanced students take over the conversation during class, no matter how interesting it may be. This can alienate beginners and consumes precious time. Advanced questions and comments can be politely reserved for office hours.\nIf you have help in the class (teaching assistants, preceptors), these folks should be vigilant for students who are falling behind and intervene early so that they do not become frustrated and give up. Frequent reminders to your students to indicate their progress will support your team in targeting problems in time. We’ll talk more about how to assess progress in a bit.\n\nNo class can possibly meet all individual training needs. However, it is entirely possible for total beginners and advanced students to come away happy from the same class. Beginners may not yet feel competent, but they may build a mental model of the domain and develop confidence that they can learn these skills because they have successfully walked through them. Advanced students may enjoy picking up “tips and tricks” or having their own self-taught approaches validated.\nDealing effectively with different skill levels does take some planning. However, with appropriate advertising and team cohesion on priorities and strategies, your workshop can be a worthwhile experience for everyone.\n\nHomework\nIn the upcoming sessions, we will be focused on the classroom. We would like you to start thinking about topics you have taught or would like to teach that involve hands-on components to them. We will be using those topics to guide some the next set of exercises."

    "section": "Working With Learning Objectives",
    "text": "Working With Learning Objectives\nSo how to we actually go about determining learning objectives? Before we go into that, we’ll take a moment to consider one framework for thinking about the learning process and developing material to accomplish learning objectives.\nBloom’s Taxonomy is a framework for thinking about learning that breaks progress down into discrete, hierarchical steps. While many ideas have come and gone in education, Bloom’s has remained a useful tool (although I suspect some of you might be groaning at this point). It remains useful because the hierarchy seems to be reasonably valid: outcomes at the top of the hierarchy cannot be achieved without mastery of outcomes at the bottom. In the long term, everybody wants to be at the top. However, in aiming to meet students where they are, we also need to be mindful about helping them to “grow a level,” helping them to recognize when they have achieved that growth, and guiding them to look ahead to where we might not be able to take them.\n\n\n\nImage credit: Vanderbilt University Center for Teaching\n\n\nWhen thinking about learning objectives for our purposes, we are going to focus on a fairly atomic level. That is, thinking about objectives for a class session or two. These will necessarily be different from objectives you would write for an entire course. I find it easiest to look at examples of learning objectives. Here are two lists of objectives. The first is from a lesson on data visualization in R.\n\nProduce scatter plots, boxplots, and time series plots using ggplot.\nSet universal plot settings.\nDescribe what faceting is and apply faceting in ggplot (ggplot is a package in R used to create plots).\nModify the aesthetics of an existing ggplot plot (including axis labels and color).\nBuild complex and customized plots from data in a data frame.\n\nOne important thing to note is that they are all starting with a verb, as they describe something a student should be able to accomplish after the lesson.\n\nExercise\nConsider the five learning objectives we saw above:\n\nProduce scatter plots, boxplots, and time series plots using ggplot.\nSet universal plot settings.\nDescribe what faceting is and apply faceting in ggplot (ggplot is a package in R used to create plots).\nModify the aesthetics of an existing ggplot plot (including axis labels and color).\nBuild complex and customized plots from data in a data frame.\n\nWhere would you place them in the pyramid of Bloom’s taxonomy?\n\nWe also want to make sure that learning objectives are something we can actually assess. Sometimes we might write vague learning objectives that we have a difficult time telling if students can do the thing we expect them to. For example, the following learning objective comes from a lesson on using spreadsheets:\n\nUnderstand how to organize data so computers can make the best use of the data\n\nWhile this understanding is important, it may not be immediately obvious how to tell if a student learned the material. In contrast, specific objectives will be easier to write assessments for:\n\nRecognize and resolve common spreadsheet formatting problems.\nDescribe the importance of metadata.\nIdentify metadata that should be included with a dataset.\nApply consistent date formats\nUse formulas to separate dates into their component values (e.g. Month, Day, Year).\n\nFor example, after teaching content to address the first point (common spreadsheet formatting problems), we could ask students to provide a better organization to these data:\n\n\nExercise\nThink about a tool (software or otherwise) that you use or teach often. If you were to write a lesson to train students how to use that tool, what are three learning objectives that would help guide the development of your lesson? Write the tool or analysis and your learning objectives in the collaborative document.\n\n\nExercise\nConsider the learning objectives you wrote above and create an assessment like the ones we described previously (multiple choice questions, faded examples, Parson’s problems, or diagram labeling). After creating this assessment, explain how you expect it to reinforce what you taught and/or identify misconceptions students may have."

    "section": "Checking in",
    "text": "Checking in\nWhen a learning objective has been met, everyone should know about it! You, as an instructor, can be satisfied that your teaching has successfully translated into learning. For students, recognizing that they have successfully learned something is motivating and it also supports their ability to monitor their own progress - this awareness, or metacognition, is especially key to supporting continued learning beyond the classroom. However, not all lessons have checkpoints built in where such progress is made clear. Where they do, they can pass unnoticed in the absence of focused recognition.\nInstructors should use a formative assessment ideally every 5 minutes and at least every 10-15 minutes in order to make sure that the class is actually learning. Since the average attention span is usually only this long, formative assessments also help break up instructional time and re-focus attention. Formative assessments can also be used preemptively: if you start a class with a question and everyone can answer it correctly, then you can safely skip the part of the lecture in which you were going to explain something that your students already know.\n\nExercise\nHow have you “checked in” with your students during class to see where they are in their learning progress?\n\n\nAvoiding “Do you understand?”\nStudents are often reluctant to admit when they do not understand. Furthermore, self-assessments of skill in the absence of formative assessment are often inaccurate because of the Dunning-Kruger effect: the less people know about a subject, the less accurate their estimate of their knowledge is. Therefore, if you ask a room full of people “Do you understand?” the result will invariably be a number of “yes” responses (many of them inaccurate) which tend to drown out a variable amount of silence. Instead, a targeted formative assessment takes the inaccuracy and stress of self-judgement away and demonstrates to all whether the students’ level of understanding has met the instructor’s goal.\n\n\nSticky Notes\nSo how you do you assess students’ progress without asking? One way is to ask for quick check-ins. If you are teaching in-person, you can start the class by handing out two sticky notes to each student, say one red one and one green one. These can act as “flags” that students can place on the back of their laptop screens to indicate when they need help (say, the red note) or when they have completed a task and are ready to move on (the green note). These are useful because:\n\nit is more discreet (which means they are more likely to actually do it),\nthey can keep working while their flag is raised, and\nthe instructor can quickly see from the front of the room what state the class is in.\n\nActive and frequent requests are most effective in getting students to actually use these well (e.g. “please put up a green sticky note if you completed the last step, and a red sticky note if you need help.”). Also, I have used “red” and “green” because those colors carry certain connotations, but you should consider other colors that are easier to differentiate by folks who cannot distinguish between red and green.\nIn online workshops, Zoom has a green circle with a check mark and red circle with an “x” under “reactions” that may be used in place of sticky notes.\n\n\nMinute Cards\nWhen possible, at the end of a session, solicit quick, anonymous feedback from your students. At an in-person session, those paper sticky notes double as minute cards, with the two different colors used for positive and constructive feedback. At an online workshop, you can use a platform like Google Forms to collect anonymous feedback.\nWhen asking for feedback, we want to provide some structure to guide responses (we will talk more about this later).\n\nExample positive prompts:\n\nOne thing you liked about this class session\nThe most important thing you learned today\nA new skill, command, or technique you are most excited about using\n\nExample constructive prompts:\n\nOne thing you did not like or would change about this class session\nOne thing that is confusing / you would like clarification on\nOne question you have\n\n\n\n\nBe explicit about using feedback\nStudents are more likely to give useful feedback if they feel that their feedback is being taken seriously. Spending a few minutes talking about the feedback you got and being explicit about what changes you are making in light of that feedback will encourage students to continue to give informative feedback throughout the course."

Teaching or sharing a classroom with demotivated students is not fun or rewarding and it can be tempting to blame students for spoiling the classroom experience.\nIt is true motivation is influenced by many factors well beyond the control of an instructor, including individual background and systemic forces. However, there are many things you can do to cultivate motivation in your classroom, and perhaps most importantly, to avoid doing harm to your students’ motivation.\nWe are going to talk about several ways that students can be motivated (or demotivated!) by instructional content and approaches, and provides practice opportunities for you to become confident in motivating your students.\n\nExercise\nThink back to courses you have taken and consider things that the instructor has said or done that you found motivating.

    "text": "Motivation\n\nAuthentic tasks\nPeople learn best when they care about a topic and believe they can master it with a reasonable investment of time and effort. Many scientists might appreciate the value of programming but believe that developing useful skills will take more time than they have available. This presents a problem because believing that something will be too hard to learn often becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.\nOne way to combat this problem is to begin a lesson with something that is quick to learn and immediately useful. It is particularly important that students see it as useful in their daily work. This not only motivates them, it also helps build their confidence in us, so that if it takes longer to get to something they find useful in a later topic, they will persist with the lesson.\nI saw a nice summary of this approach that was a riff off Michael Pollan’s three simple rules for eating that goes something like:\n\nWrite good code\nNot too much\nMostly plots\n\n(the original rules were “Eat food, not too much, mostly plants.”)\nImagine a graph whose axes are labeled “mean time to master” and “usefulness once mastered”. Tasks that are quick to master and immediately useful should ideally be taught first; things in the opposite corner that are time-consuming to learn and have little near-term application should be avoided for short data science modules.\n\n\n\nSource: The Carpentries\n\n\n\n\nInvite Participation\nMotivation is supported by active engagement. Participation allows students to ask questions, which can resolve roadblocks quickly, and demonstrate knowledge, which helps build confidence. However, I think we have all experienced how many students will not immediately feel comfortable speaking up, especially when they feel confusion or doubt. Creating a motivating classroom means being explicit about inviting communication and reinforcing that invitation with an attentive response.\nA few ways to invite participation are:\n\nEstablish norms for interaction. This can be done by creating procedures for communication, e.g. turn taking in discussions or encouraging quieter people to contribute. Having, discussing, and enforcing a class code of conduct also provides a framework for positive communication to occur.\nEncouraging students to learn from each other. Working in pairs encourages students to talk through their learning process, reinforcing memory and making it more likely that confusion will be expressed and resolved. This can also address challenges of varying background experience: asking more advanced students to help beginners can maximize learning for both.\nAcknowledging when students are confused. Acknowledging and exploring confusion with kindness rewards students for sharing vulnerable information. Furthermore, When students see that others are confused, they are more likely to share their own uncertainties."

Share your example in the collaborative document.\n\n\nFirst, Do No Harm!\nWhen learning a skill we develop opinions about tools and methods, and sometimes base a professional identity around displaying technical expertise. Technical boasts, insults, and other showy moves present serious hazards in the classroom! Here are a few things you should not do:\n\nTalk contemptuously or with scorn about any tool or practice, or the people who use them. Regardless of its shortcomings, many of your students may be using that tool, and may have invested many years in learning to do so. Convincing someone to change their practices is much harder when they think that you disdain them.\nDive into complex or detailed technical discussion with the one or two people in the audience who clearly don’t actually need to be there. Reserve those conversations for office hours or follow-up emails.\nPretend to know more than you do. People will actually trust you more if you are frank about the limitations of your knowledge, and will be more likely to ask questions and seek help. This is tough, because it is important that your students view you as qualified to teach the material, and we have probably all encountered precocial students (or faculty), who want to show how smart they are by tripping up the instructor. Nonetheless, be aware of where your limits are and don’t hesistate to use the “I’ll follow up on that” response.\nUse the J word (“just”) or other demotivating language. These signal to the student that the instructor thinks their problem is trivial and by extension that they therefore must be deficient if they are not able to figure it out. It is tempting to use this language in an effort to convince students that a task is as easy to learn as it is for you to accomplish. Saying something like “Look, you just clone the repo locally, checkout a new branch, make the edit, commit, push, submit a PR and boom, you’re done.” in an introduction to GitHub is likely going to have the opposite effect from what was intended.\nTake over the student’s keyboard. It is rarely a good idea to type anything for your students. Doing so can be demotivating for the student (as it implies you don’t think they can do it themselves or that you don’t want to wait for them). It also wastes a valuable opportunity for your student to develop muscle memory and other skills that are essential for independent work.\nExpress surprise at unawareness. Saying things like “I can’t believe you don’t know X” or “You’ve never heard of Y?” signals to the student that they do not have some required pre-knowledge of the material you are teaching, that they don’t belong in the class, and it may prevent them from asking questions in the future. (For more on this see the Recurse Center’s Social Rules).\n\nIt can be difficult to avoid these demotivators entirely. Some people are so used to complaining about certain tools that they initially fail to realize they’re doing it while teaching. If you catch yourself doing this, you might find a way to walk it back, or consider how you might repair or improve your motivational efforts on your next interaction. Teaching yourself to avoid these types of comments takes practice, but is well worth the effort."

    "text": "Feedback is hard\nSometimes it can be hard to receive feedback, especially negative feedback.\n\n\n\nImage credit: deathbulge.com\n\n\nFeedback is most effective when the people involved share ground rules and expectations. One useful approach is to balance feedback on what works with constructive feedback on areas that could use improvement (and how they could be improved). We also want feedback on both what is being taught (the content) and how it is being taught (the presentation). Each person giving feedback is expected to provide at least one piece of negative and one piece of positive feedback each for content and delivery. This helps overcome two common tendencies when giving feedback on teaching: to focus on the content (even though delivery is at least as important) and to either provide only negative or only positive feedback.\nA couple ways you can set the stage for receiving or providing feedback are:\n\nInitiate feedback. Most people will not offer it freely, and those who do are not the only voices you should listen to. Also, it is easier to hear feedback that you have asked for.\nBe specific. What do you want feedback on? As an instructor one way to get specific feedback is to provide questions that focus the responses. Writing your own feedback questions allows you to frame feedback in a way that is helpful to you - the questions below reveal what did not work in your teaching, but read as professional suggestions rather than personal judgments. For example:\n\n“What is one thing I could have done as an instructor to make this lesson more effective?”\n“If you could pick one thing from the lesson to go over again, what would it be?”\n\nBalance positive and negative feedback.\n\nAsk for or give “compliment sandwiches” (one positive, one negative, one positive)\nAsk for both types of feedback, and give both types.\n\nWhen you are giving feedback, provide a clear next step with negative feedback to follow that will help the recipient improve. i.e. Don’t be reviewer 2!\nCommunicate expectations. If your teaching feedback is taking the form of an observation (and you are comfortable enough with the observer), tell that person how they can best communicate their feedback to you.\nWhen giving feedback, remember that giving and receiving feedback is a skill that requires practice, so do not be frustrated if your feedback is rejected but try to think about why the recipient might not have been comfortable with the feedback you gave.\nUse a feedback translator. Have someone else read over all the feedback and give an executive summary. It can be easier to hear “It sounds like most people are ahead with the materials, so you could speed up” rather than reading a bunch of notes that all say “this is too slow”.\nFinally, be kind to yourself. If you are a self-critical person, it is OK to remind yourself:\n\nThe feedback is not personal. In many cases, feedback says more about the person giving it than the person receiving it.\nThere are always positives along with the negatives. Save your favorites.\n\n\n\nProvide feedback\nWe will start by observing an example of teaching and providing some feedback.\n\nExercise\nWatch this example teaching video and then give feedback on it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ApVt04rB4U. Put your feedback in the collaborative document. Organize your feedback along two axes: positive vs. opportunities for growth (sometimes called “negative”) and content (what was said) vs. presentation (how it was said).\n\n\n\nReceive feedback\nNow that you have had some practice observing teaching and giving feedback, let us practice with each other.\n\nExercise\nThe prep time for this exercise is intentionally short - the point is to practice giving and receiving feedback, not to create a perfect presentation. Imperfect presentations will give you more to work with!\n\nSplit into groups of three (your instructor will likely send you to breakout rooms, or if you are co-located, will assign groups).\nIndividually, spend 5 minutes preparing a 90-second introduction to the topic you picked out after last session. You won’t be doing any “live coding” or exercises with your audience (this time).\nGet together with your group and have one person teach their segment to the group. Keep a strict time limit of 90 seconds per person (one person should be responsible for the timekeeping).\nAfter the first person has finished teaching, share feedback. The person who performed should start by offering feedback on themselves. The timekeeper should help to keep feedback to about 5 minutes per person to ensure everyone has time to perform and discuss.\nRotate roles and repeat steps 3 & 4.\nReturn to the main group and briefly summarize the feedback you received in the collaborative document.\n\n\n\n\nUse feedback\n\nExercise\nLook back at the feedback you received on your teaching. How do you feel about this feedback? Is it fair and reasonable? Do you agree with it?\nIdentify at least one specific change you will make to your teaching based on this feedback. Describe your change in the collaborative document."

Having students help each other also helps to reinforce the germane concepts.\nIdeally we make these experiences interactive events for students and instructors. We give and receive feedback throughout the course of an instructional session. We incorporate assessments within the lesson materials and ask for feedback as part of the class session.\nFor many of your students, this may be their very first exposure to the skill or tool that you are teaching. Because of this, the material you present is not simply a source of information; it is the starting point for the development of a new skill.

    "text": "Skills acquisition\nWhen we think about developing skills, we can use a model where students advance through three different stages: novice, intermediate, and expert. This model is a simplification of the Dreyfus model of skill acquisition.\n\nNovice: someone who does not know what they do not know, i.e., they do not yet know what the key ideas in the domain are or how they relate. Novices may have difficulty formulating questions, or may ask questions that seem irrelevant or off-topic as they rely on prior knowledge, without knowing what is or is not related yet.\n\nExample: A novice might never have heard the R programming language, and therefore may have no understanding of how it can be used to perform analyses and automate tasks.\n\nIntermediate (AKA a competent practitioner): someone who has enough understanding for everyday purposes. They will not know all the details of how something works and their understanding may not be entirely accurate, but it is sufficient for completing normal tasks with normal effort under normal circumstances.\n\nExample: An intermediate might have used the R programming language before and understand how to modify existing code and write short scripts.\n\nExpert: someone who can easily handle situations that are out of the ordinary.\n\nExample: An expert may have experience writing their own functions in R and using them in complex workflows. When presented with a problem, immediately sees how these skills can be used to solve the problem.\n\n\n\nExercise\nIn the collaborative document, add the name of someone you think of as an expert. They don’t have to be in your field, just someone who has acquired enough skill to qualify as an expert as we just defined. After their name, explain why they are an expert.\n\nNote that how a person feels about their skill level is not included in these definitions! You may or may not consider yourself an expert in a particular subject, but may nonetheless function at that level in certain contexts. For now, we are primarily concerned with novices, as this is often the level students are encountering data science applications.\nIt is common to think of a novice as a sort of an “empty vessel” into which knowledge can be “poured.” Unfortunately, this analogy includes inaccuracies that can generate dangerous misconceptions. In our next section, we will briefly explore the nature of “knowledge” through a concept that helps us differentiate between novices and intermediates in a more useful and visual way. This, in turn, will have implications for how we teach."

    "section": "Mental models",
    "text": "Mental models\nUnderstanding is never a mirror of reality, even for an expert; rather, it is an internal representation based on our experience with a subject. This internal representation is often described as a mental model. A mental model allows us to extrapolate, or make predictions beyond and between the narrow limits of experience and memory, filling in gaps to the point that things “make sense.”\nAs we learn, our mental model evolves to become more complex and, most importantly, more useful. A useful model makes reasonable predictions and fits well within the range of things we are likely to encounter. While there will always be inaccuracies – or “misconceptions” – these do not interfere with day-to-day functioning. A useful model does not seize up or break down entirely as new concepts are added.\nA mental model may be represented as a collection of concepts and facts, connected by relationships. The mental model of an expert in any given subject will be far larger and more complex than that of a novice, including both more concepts and more detailed and numerous relationships.\nA more general tool that is useful for exploring any network of concepts and relationships is a concept map. A concept map asks you to identify which concepts are most relevant to a topic at hand and – critically – to identify how they are connected. It can be quite difficult to identify and organize these connections! However, the process of forcing abstract knowledge into a visual format can force you to name connections that you might otherwise have quietly assumed, or illuminate gaps that you may not have been aware of.\nHere is a fairly simple concept map that illustrates the relationships between a car, it’s engine, and the wheels. We start a concept map by just adding the concepts, or the parts of the model. In this case, we have three boxes, labeled “engine”, “car”, and “wheels”:\n\n\n\nThe start of a concept map\n\n\nThe next part of a concept map would be to draw lines or edges to indicate the relationships among the different components. Here we add a line connecting the engine and the wheels, and the wheels and the car. In the figure we add that the engine spins, turning the wheels, and that the wheels move and propel the car.\n\n\n\nDrawing relationships in the concept map\n\n\nThis is a fairly simplified concept map, but it shows how a mental model of how a car works can be represented graphically.\nSome additional examples of concept maps are:\n\nfor loops in Python https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carpentries/instructor-training/gh-pages/fig/for-loop-rec.png\nSimplified carbon cycle https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carpentries/instructor-training/390de72105bad961a0c1beac09be2cc933a84f88/fig/Tree3.svg\n\n\nConcept maps are not mental models\nIt is easy to confuse these two terms. We cannot “see” a person’s mental model, this term is an abstract description of how someone understands some part of the world. We can use concept maps as a visual representation of a mental model, but there are plenty of nuances of understanding that may be missed in a concept map. To misquote George Box, “All concept maps are wrong, but some are useful.”\n\nExercise\nDraw a concept map for a mental model of something you teach. Start by identifying the “things” or parts of the model - these are the boxes (or circles if you prefer that shape). Next draw relationships as lines connecting the shapes. Use arrows if there is directionality to the relationship. You can do this on paper or with your computer; an online tool for this can be found at https://excalidraw.com/."

In this map, a student links the speed at which the engine turns directly to the speed of the car.\n\n\n\nA misconception that higher engine speeds always mean higher car velocity\n\n\nSo it turns out this is not necessarily how things work. In fact, a direct coupling of the engine to the wheels would most likely cause a car to violently shake itself apart in a matter of seconds.\nWhen mental models break, learning can occur more slowly than you might expect. The longer a prior model was in use, and the more extensively it has to be unlearned, the more it can actively interfere with the incorporation of new knowledge. Our students may quickly adapt to this new information if they had never thought much about how engine speed relates to car speed before and were simply trying out an existing mental model on a new situation. However, if they had extensive experience with the broken model above, it may take longer to unlearn what they thought they understood about how car speed is regulated.\nAn updated version of this model would include the transmission, which allows the engine speed to stay relatively constant even when traveling at different speeds.\n\n\n\nMental models often grow to become more accurate\n\n\nMost mental models worth mapping are not so simple. Yet, forcing complex ideas in to this simplified format can be useful when preparing to teach, because it forces you to be explicit about exactly what concepts are at the heart of your topic, and to name relationships between them.\n\nExercise\nCount the number of things in your concept map (lines and items) and add that number to the collaborative document."

    "section": "Formative assessments",
    "text": "Formative assessments\nIn order to effectively root out pre-existing misconceptions that need to be un-learned and stop quietly developing misconceptions in their tracks, we need to be actively and persistently looking for them. But how?\nLike so many challenges we will discuss in this training, the answer is feedback. In this case, we want feedback that allows us to assess the developing mental model of a student in highly specific ways, to verify that learning is proceeding according to plan and not careening off in some unpredicted direction. We want to get this feedback while we teach so that we can respond to that information and adapt our instruction to get students back on track.\nThis kind of assessment has a name: it is called formative assessment because it is applied during learning to form the practice of teaching and the experience of the student. This is different from exams, for example, which sum up what a participant has learned but are not used to guide further progress and are hence called summative.\nFeedback from formative assessment illuminates misconceptions for both instructors and students. It also provides reassurance on both sides when learning is proceeding on track. It is far more reliable than reading faces or using feelings of comfort as a metric, which tends to be what instructors and students default to otherwise.\nFormative assessments can serve many purposes other than hunting down misconceptions, such as verifying engagement or supporting memory consolidation. We will discuss some of these functions in later on. In this section, we are interested quite narrowly in evaluating mental models.\nOne example of formative assessment that can be used to tease out misconceptions is the multiple choice question (MCQ). When designed carefully, these can target anticipated misconceptions with surgical precision. For example, suppose we are teaching children multi-digit addition. A well-designed MCQ would be:\nQ: what is 27 + 15 ?\na) 42\nb) 32\nc) 312\nd) 33\nThe correct answer is (a) 42, but the other answers provide information.\n\nExercise\nChoose one wrong answer and write in the collaborative document what misconception is associated with that wrong answer.\nSolution\n\nIf the student answers 32, they forgot to carry the 1 to the tens place.\nIf they answer 312, they know that they cannot just discard the carried 1, but do not understand that it is actually a ten and needs to be added into the next column. In other words, they are treating each column of numbers as unconnected to its neighbors.\nIf they answer 33 then they know they have to carry the 1, but are carrying it back into the same column it came from.\n\n\nEach of these incorrect answers has diagnostic power Each answer looks like it could be right. Silly answers like “a fish!” may offer therapeutic comedy but do not provide insight; nor do answers that are wrong in random ways. “Diagnostic power” means that each of the wrong choices helps the instructor figure out precisely what misconceptions students have adopted when they select that choice.\n\nExercise\nConsider your concept map and write a multiple choice question to identify points where the mental model represented might be broken.\n\nYou can find more information on designing effective multiple choice questions at:\n\nhttps://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/writing-good-multiple-choice-test-questions/\nhttps://sites.chem.utoronto.ca/chemistry/dstone/teachers/mcguide2.html\nhttps://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/bes2.1468"

    "text": "Going slow\nIt takes work to actively assess mental models throughout a class; this also takes time. This can make instructors feel conflicted about using formative assessment routinely because it may seem like wasted time or busywork.\nIf our goal is to help novices students construct an accurate and useful mental model of a new intellectual domain, this will impact our teaching. For example, we principally want to help students form the right categories and make connections among concepts. We do not want to overload them with a slew of unrelated facts, as this will be confusing.\nAn important practical implication of this latter point is the pace of teaching. Learning consists of more than “just” adding information to mental models; creating linkages between concepts and facts is at least as important. Making sure to teach at a pace that allows reflection and reinforcement of those linkages it critical for students’ progress."

How does your experience when you are acting as an expert differ from when you are not an expert?\n\nBecause your students’ mental models will likely be less densely connected than your own, a conclusion that seems obvious to you will not seem that way to your students. It is important to explain what you are doing step-by-step, and how each step leads to the next one.\n\nAny Questions?\nAnother well-intended move that can go wrong is the call for questions. An instructor may accidentally dismiss student confusion by asking for questions in a way that reveals that they do not actually expect that anyone will have them. Asking, “Does anyone have any questions?” or “Do you all understand?” implies that most people will not; the shorter the wait time before moving on, the more this implication is magnified. Instead, consider asking “What questions do you have?” and leaving a healthy pause for consideration. This firmly establishes an expectation that people will, indeed, have questions, and should challenge themselves to formulate them."

We will also talk about the limits of human memory, how learning works, and how we can use that understanding to craft our instructional practices.\nIn the second week, we turn to the classroom environment, starting with the concept of reverse instructional design. We will discuss how to motivate students and how not to demotivate them. We will also have discussions about improving equity, inclusion, and accessibility in data science training.\nThe third week will focus on the practice of teaching data science skills and how we can intentionally improve our skills as teachers.\nThe fourth week will be putting all this into practice, with opportunities to practice live coding instruction and getting started with lesson development.\nWe will switch gears in weeks five and six, focusing on our own skills development in programming and data tools.\n\nExercise\nWhat are your goals for this training?
