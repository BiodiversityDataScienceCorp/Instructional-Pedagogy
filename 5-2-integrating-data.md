# Integrating Data Sets

## Lesson objectives

+ Write formative assessments to measure progress on learning objectives

## Overview

Once the dataset is in place, you can start to design assessments that provide 
students an opportunity to practice the skills that you have described through 
your learning objectives. Writing the assessments before writing the content of 
the lesson ensures that the lesson will remain focused, and can reveal gaps in 
your objectives.

**Exercise**

Explain in the collaborative document _how_ your students will access the 
datasets for your data science module (i.e. download from a database, link to a 
Google Sheet, generate data on their own).

## Designing assessments

The assessments in a lesson should be a mixture of direct application and 
synthesis. A direct application is a straightforward implementation of a 
concept that students have just been exposed to, while synthesis requires 
students to integrate recently learned skills with skills that were covered 
earlier in the lesson. Learning is reinforced when instructors explicitly point 
out how the skills seen in earlier parts of the lesson are being used in the 
assessment.

These assessments help students further their learning by having a chance to 
put into practice the skills being taught. They also help you monitor the level 
of understanding in the classroom, and potentially catch misconceptions in the 
student's mental models that can be corrected in real time, before they become 
ingrained.

Now take time writing assessments for your remaining learning objectives. After
30 minutes you will have an opportunity to provide one another feedback.

**Homework**

Next week will focus on opportunities for developing your data science modules. 
We will have working sessions and time for peer feedback. If you are so 
inclined, we will also have time for you to pilot a portion of your lesson 
through a teaching demonstration. Please be prepared next week to work on your 
modules and do a teaching demonstration if you would like feedback.
